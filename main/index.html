<p>This document is created and updated by members of the Catastrophe Crow community to follow the alternate reality game centering on the eponymous game. </p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">ARG?</p>
<p>An alternate reality game, or ARG, is a story that claims to be real and features audience interaction, sometimes interacting with the real world. “Catastrophe Crow!”, or “Crow 64” is a fictional game developed by Manfred Lorenz and Opus Interactive for the Nintendo 64. Opus Interactive went under, the game got trapped in development Hell, and until recently, Manfred Lorenz was believed dead. Adam Butcher’s research and resulting video “WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64?” brought attention to this game, and community has formed around documenting its peculiarities and the events surrounding it.</p>

<p>To be clear, Catastrophe Crow, Manfred Lorenz, and the events surrounding them are completely fictional, but this document will generally discuss them as if they were real for convenience. Adam and Luke Butcher are real individuals who have done a multitude of work outside of Catastrophe Crow. In addition, while there are interactable elements, please use caution when interacting. We do not want to accidentally bother individuals not connected to the ARG.There is a real company named Opus Interactive, but it is completely unrelated to the Opus Interactive of Catastrophe Crow.</p>

<p>This document aims to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Document the game Catastrophe Crow and the story around it</li>
<li>Research and explain their oddities</li>
<li>Collect the research in an easily accessible manner</li>

<p>An online C# decoder is available for both of the text based ciphers, usage should be fairly self explanatory: simply change the parameters for functions like CrowTranslateFrom or CrowDecipher. <a href="https://dotnetfiddle.net/b7qC7v">Link to decoder here</a>.</p>

<p>Some text that appears in the game might appear garbled / nonsensical, this is most likely due to it being in <em>“Crow Language.”</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbhYLxrcLPI">catastrophe crow n64 playthrough</a> by N64 Long Lost Lore</strong> includes the Pause screen both pre-garble (at 0:30) and post-garble (at 3:00), using these two bits we can build a map between the regular alphabet and the Crow alphabet. Letters not present in this screen have been deduced over time by filling in the blanks when deciphering various messages.</p>

<p>For example, if you start with the word “password,” you would replace each letter with a letter from the top row as seen in the table below.</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="../images/image25.jpg" width="150" /></p>
<p>The result is “UWAASLIX.” This can then be decoded back into “password” by replacing each letter from the top row with one from the bottom row, or in other words doing the same process in reverse.</p>
<p>Interestingly, “Thea” encodes to “Crow,” “Crow” encodes to “Nils,” and “Nils” encodes to “Thea” in Crow Language.</p>

<p>In case a series of digits is stumbled upon, it’s most likely that it can be used to decode into another piece of text. One such series can be found in the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irEb9TS9yEk">WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64?</a> by AdamButcher (at 4:22). The table for decoding text that uses this cipher appears in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA3Ju4DqmOo">Forest Level</a> by N64ExcavationMan (at 3:38).</p>
<p>Series of digits are used as values for the Y axis while repeating characters of a keyword, all of which so far being a person’s name are used for the X axis. Currently discovered functional keywords are Nils, Thea, and Crow.</p>

<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Deciphering Example</p>
<p>Digits: 30781354841</p>
<p>Name: NILS</p>
<p>For the first letter of the result, take the letter from row 3 column N, then row 0 column I, etc. In most cases the name will be shorter than the amount of digits, in that case just keep repeating it. The “full name” for the above cipher can be understood as NILSNILSNIL.</p>
<p>After deciphering we get the result NILSIMALIVE.</p>

<h3 id="keyboard-sound-cipher">Keyboard Sound Cipher<a class="headerlink" href="#keyboard-sound-cipher" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF5THpGez-w">Catastrophe Crow! – Underground Level</a> by Childhood Memories 64 from 0:49 onwards, the Crow steps on various keys on a computer keyboard. Each sound corresponds to one letter. Using these sounds, one can map audio cues in videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uky7-lSOnq0">Video</a> back to Crow Language and then to regular words. A soundboard with all the individual sounds is available <a href="https://blerp.com/soundboard/5f8ab81eea7ee1000f0be654">here</a>.</p>
<p>The first letter of a sound’s name often corresponds to the keyboard letter that makes it. For example B for Bell, P for Phone, etc.</p>

<p><em>Pronounced [man.frɛt lɔ.rɛnts] (maan-fret lau-rents)</em>
<img alt="Image" src="../images/image73.jpg" width="&quot;300" /></p>
<p>The illustrious creator of Catastrophe Crow and Ocean Quest and lead programmer at now-defunct Opus Interactive. Noted perfectionist, and receiver of two Golden Joysticks and an AIAS Hall of Fame Award. Late in development of Catastrophe Crow, his home life had fallen apart and he had not seen his family for months. In the final months he was the final and only developer on the project as all other staff members were let go.</p>
<p>Believed to be dead after his disappearance off of Cuxhaven. He left a cryptic note to his wife that said, among other things, that he had finally gone home. Recent email correspondence with a “M L” suggests he is still alive and aware of the search around Catastrophe Crow. The names of the channels can also be merged together to form his name, and M L comments about them confirm that M L created them.</p>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title"> </p>
<p>Retrogamingcollectibles, the eBay seller who sold Adam’s cartridge, is believed to be Manfred and intended to sell the game to Nils,but Adam bought it instead.</p>

<ul>
<li>Initials match</li>
<li>M L speaks of Marta in the third person</li>
<li>Speaks to Nils as a family member</li>

<p>The protagonist of the game. Has typical platformer skills, including ledge grabbing, wall jumping, and a triple jump aided by his wings. Due to an injury, he is unable to fly, and his left wing is held in a bandage.</p>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title"> </p>
<p>Generally agreed to represent Thea Lorenz.</p>
</div>
<p>His name is given as “Mr. Crow” in the Planet 64 scan, but simply as “Crow” in N64 Future Look. As the first was from 1997 and the second from 1999. His name is given as “Mr. Crow” and gender as male in this document for the sake of clarity. Thea’s drawing gives his name as “Katastrophe Krähe [sic]”, which is German for “Catastrophe Crow.”</p>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title"> </p>
<p>it is possible that his name was officially changed between the two articles. This could also suggest that Manfred had begun to project Thea more onto Mr. Crow</p>

<p>Evidence supporting Mr. Crow representing Thea:</p>
<ul>
<li>She created the original design for Catastrophe Crow.</li>
<li>This is only for your little brother now.” from Keyboard Cipher #1 suggests that TheaLorenz is dead.</li>
<li>In Crow Language, “Thea” becomes “Crow”.</li>

<p>The Brother Crow appears in Let’s Play Catastrophe Crow! Ep. 1 and Forest Level after Mr. Crow interacts with the mirror in the Forest Level. Unlike Mr. Crow, he is missing the bandage on the right wing, has green eyes, and is also shorter. Unlike Mr. Crow, he is able to fly, with no apparent limit seen so far, allowing him to travel to parts of levels that Mr. Crow is unable to reach.</p>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title"> </p>
<p>Almost certainly a separate character from Mr. Crow, and possibly the same character as Crawler. He is believed to represent Nils</p>
</div>
<p>Evidence supporting Brother Crow representing Nils:</p>
<ul>
<li>horter than Mr. Crow, paralleling how Nils was shorter than Thea</li>
<li>Father Crow’s comment about how “you always looked alike” in Let’s Play Catastrophe Crow! Ep. 1. If Thea is Mr. Crow, then it follows that Nils’s representative looks like Thea’s.</li>
<li>“Nils” in Crow Language decodes to “Crow” in plaintext.</li>
<li>Inside the Unity project he is called “Brother Crow.”</li>

<p>A glasses-wearing older crow, presumed to be the father of Mr. Crow. No official name known. Briefly becomes the player character at 11:26 in WHAT HAPPEND TO CROW 64 until the end of the video after Mr. Crow falls down the stairs. He also jumps off his boat earlier in the video.</p>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title"> </p>
<p>General consensus among the researchers is that he represents Manfred</p>
</div>
<p>Evidence supporting the Manfred=Father Crow Theory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Father Crow jumpingoff a boat with computer equipment in WHAT HAPPEND TO CROW 64, paralleling Manfred’s disappearance and presumed death in the North Sea.</li>
<li>Is the only worker at the “work building,” and is apparently a programmer.</li>
<li>Is a father, like Manfred.</li>
<li>Fits in with the general consensus that Mr. Crow represents Manfred’s child.</li>
<li>Wears glasses, like Manfred.</li>

<p>Are you out there, reading this somehow?</p>
<p>Or have you chosen not to remember me?</p>
<p>10/19 1:37 PM</p>
<p>Nils L: Well my name is Nils Lorenz, I was born in Germany where I lived when I was really young, and my father was a game developer named Manfred, I even distinctly remember the Crow character, but my father died when I was very young. At least that’s what my mother always told me. I’ve been seeing these videos of this incredibly familiar game, with strange messages that seem like they’re aimed at me, but I’m unsure what to think of it. I don;t know how to feel about this situation and I don’t know if I can trust you. I feel like I’m dreaming. Is there anything you can do to clear this up for me? Is there anything you can tell me so I know it’s you? Something from my childhood. Where did my sister go to school? Where did we vacation. What was our house like?</p>
<p>10/19</p>
<p>ML:You speak like him, as I imagine he would. With questions painful to answer.</p>
<p>But the imposters multiply, I feel I cannot take another step.</p>
<p>All I can do is wait. Perhaps it is just a little longer.</p>
<p>10/20 10:49</p>
<p>Nils L:I guess that’s understandable, but know I am being honest. This whole situation is gnawing at the back of my mind, and I’ve been struggling with how to handle everything. I’d like answers. But if you feel unsure I understand, as I feel the same way. Take as much time as you need. I will be here. Waiting.</p>
<p>10/21</p>
<p>M L: I see us standing on either side of the chasm. Neither alive or dead. But the gap only grows wider.</p>

<p>K: Hello, my name is Kaleb, growing up my favorite genera of game was the 3D platformer and the genre still remains in a special part of my heart today. I’m always looking for a classic platformer I haven;t played yet, so when a game I never heard of stared popping up in my recommendation box it instantly got my attention and I was intrigued to find out that these videos had hidden messages in them. You may have seen some of my comments on some of the videos picking apart their puzzles. I now realize that while these videos are public these messages weren’t intended for everyone. But still, I am touched by your story from what I can make of it. So if there is anything I can do to help please let me know.</p>

<p>N64LLL: Hello, I'm "N64 Long Lost Lore"! I've been recently playing one of your games (Catastrophe Crow) on my channel and it's been pretty fun! It reminds me of numerous other platformers, yet it's bigger and better than them. I've been looking into the company you managed and worked on the game (Opus Interactive) and I found another game you worked on, "Ocean Quest". Another channel like mine uploaded a song from the game. I'm curious if you have any more information on it, since I was quite fascinated by Catastrophe Crow. So if you don't mind, could you share some details with me? Thanks!</p>
<p>ML: And “Lore”</p>
<p>Another creation running by itself</p>
<p>N64LLL: Someone was recently selling a development of Catastrophe Crow on the site ebay.com 2 weeks ago. For details, it had a label with numerous dates on it on the bottom, and it had "CROW" written in sharpie on the top. I was about to buy it but someone bought it before me, right after I discovered the Ebay page, to be exact. But here's a screenshot I took before they bought it.</p>
<p>A screenshot of the eBay auction from the documentary was included.</p>
<p>Would you happen to know information about who bought it, or the seller? Really just any information you happen to know about the cartridge sold on Ebay? If so, please share the information with me! Thanks!</p>

<p>A binary code is played through sound after the “speech” sound effect plays, decoding to a seven by five pixel image of a key, as shown on the right.</p>
<p>This video shows actual gameplay, with Father Crow walking up the archway in the Grounds. On the other side is a teddy bear, which appears in a transformation starting with Mr. Crow, changing to Brother Crow, before settling on the Teddy Bear and below street lights can be seen. In the background is a dark cityscape not seen in the other videos. A frame before cutting to black, the Teddy Bear is replaced by a pawn.</p>
<p>The video’s tags are: "all", "live", "on", "things", "somehow". These tags are in the same order they were found in.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Unity Key Crack</p>
<p>This video dropped AFTER the community cracked the Unity dump.</p>
</div>
<p>The video begins with Father Crow standing on the left side of the archway. Several seconds pass, and then the Teddy Bear appears, with the DIALOGUE START sound playing. A static code is then heard, which translates to 5x7 images of a pyramid and an ankh. Teddy Bear seems to float forward, and Father Crow leaps off the archway, meeting Teddy Bear in the air. The screen cuts to black.</p>
<h3 id="ascend">Ascend<a class="headerlink" href="#ascend" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Father Crow is seen then rocketing upwards, through several stages of the game. An increasingly high-pitched sound plays while he does this, perhaps bits of ERS START. As he exits a final pyramid shaped texture, and enters a white void, ERS START is heard, though in a glitched manner. Father Crow then disappears, leaving the white void present until the video ends.</p>
<p>The tags on this video are, in order: “and","feared","have","leap","long","so","the","you". </p>
<p>This, combined with the video prior, when rearranged, seems to spell out: "All things must live on somehow, and so long you have feared the leap". We have been given this message in email, by ML.</p>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title"> </p>
<p>With the tags given to us, the ERS START sound playing, and the model of Father Crow ‘ascending’, then disappearing, this video could signify Manfred exiting the game, alive, with the intention to locate Nils and take him into the game. Player interaction, represented by the Teddy Bear, could have freed him, and ERS START is what is played when the Eternal Revival System kicks in.</p>

<p>The letters are in alphabetical order, meaning thatmore likely than not there is nothing coded within them.Diagram on page 44c, “1-bit Image Compression Algorithm,” is a clue to using the binary audio cipher, which interprets binary audio as 1-bit information.

<p class="admonition-title">Stone the Crows!</p>
<p>A surprise addition to the main presentation at Spaceworld was Catastrophe Crow, a game bearing more than a passing resemblance to Rare’s own animal-related newie, Banjo-Kazooie.Its playing set-up will be comfortably familiar to most Mario-followers, with the eponymous ‘Crow legging it around lushly-created 3D worlds and jumping on badguys’ heads.¹</p>
<p>The demo showed off all kinds of fluid moves from wall-jumps to hanging-off-ledges, but we suspect we’ll never fly until we get that bandage off our wing…</p>
<p>The slightly-hard-to-read Press Release promised ‘fearless exploration of unfamiliar worlds’² and detailed a surreal plot about trying to save your father’s business from a corporate takeover by the sinister Sir Cat.</p>
<p>The company skyscraper appears to form a Peach’s-Castle-style hub from which you access a range of unique-looking worlds, from a misty forest to a land of giant toys to some kind of mysterious Ancient Egyptian Spaceship thing-y. And while the format currently screams ‘SM64-clone’ the developers have promised something called an ‘eternal revival system’ to keep things changing every time you play.</p>
<p>This will be the first N64-outing from Opus Interactive, a German developer helmed by director Manfred Lorenz, whose action-adventure Ocean Questwas a surprise late hit for the SNES.</p>
<p>With an unconfirmed release date set not for another two years, we expect more information to come through rather slowly on this one. But considering Opus Interactive’s lasting reputation for great gameplay and impressive world-building, we at N64can’t wait to actually get our thumbs on it</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="../images/image109.jpg" width="250" /></p>
<p>Mr Crow sure looks cute, even as he navigates a somewhat creepy block world. Is that a teddy bear looming in the mist?⁴</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="../images/image20.jpg" width="250" /></p>
<p>Loads to explore, but I wouldn’t trust those berries</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="../images/image59.jpg" width="250" /></p>
<p>Flap! Woosh! With the help of some triple jump acroba-tics, going to work looks kinda fun!</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="../images/image43.jpg" width="250" /></p>
<p>Scary monsters in the forest. Nightmarish!⁵</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="../images/image61.jpg" width="250" /></p>
<p>Almost as strangely laid-out as our office…</p>
<p>Those chess enemies move according to chess rules. Nice!</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="../images/image115.jpg" width="250" /></p>
<p>¹ No goomba-stomps have been seen in any of the videos.</p>
<p>² British styled quotes. This scan was probably originally published in Britain.</p>
<p>³ This surreal plot hasn’t been seen in video yet, and neither has Sir Cat. In addition, the parallels to Opus’s own troubles can’t be overlooked.</p>
<p>⁴ Notice the carpet, different from the grass seen in the videos, and the fog.</p>
<p>⁵ The door appears to be a modified version of the door used in Mario Party 2’s Horror Land Board.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">CATASTROPHE CROW!</p>
<p>We’ve had our beady N64 eye on Catastrophe Crow!For quite a few issues now. In development at Opus Interactive’s Hamburg base for something approaching three years, it’s a game that’s looked consistently amazing in every screenshot we’ve seen. When given the opportunity to play it for ourselves, we jumped at the chance.</p>
<p>Visuals·The game brims with imagination and wonder, and, thanks to the expansion pak, is rendered in bright ultra-crisp detail.</p>
<p>Based on a very strange storyline indeed, Catastrophe Crow!Consists of nine massive 3D worlds in desperate need of exploration. You play as the eponymous Crow, who runs head-first into their¹ father’s office to collect Power Coins and stop a corporate takeover by the evil Sir Cat.</p>
<p>Much like Peach’s Castle in Super Mario 64, this tower block serves as a hub-world to get you to each exciting new level - jumping appropriately into computer screens to explore the levels within.</p>
<p>And explore we did. Because Catastrophe Crow!Is absolutely brimming with imagination and wonder. We’ve clambered up giant teddy bears, sneaked around misty forests and hot-footed our way through a giant lava-powered machine. It’s truly giving Super Mario 64and Banjo-Kazooiea run for their money in terms of world design.</p>
<p>Of course, where comparisons are also going to be made is to SM64’s move-set, which emphasises free-wheeling acrobatics over BK’s more complicated-and-sometimes-clunky moves. We’ve enjoyed flipping from triple-jumps to wall-jumps to hanging off ledges. If Crow’s wing wasn’t so adorably bandaged maybe we might even fly...perhaps an unlockable secret if we collect enough Power Coins.</p>
<p>But while jumping on platforms and battling bizarre baddies is exceptionally fun, the few hours we’ve spent with the game have slowly revealed a surprisingly deep and puzzle-y extra layer. The more we;ve explored, the more we’ve got a sense of the game hiding something larger...cryptic clues in character dialog, a strange code found in forgotten corners of the levels, even a bizarre sci-fi pyramid filled with hieroglyphics.</p>
<p>Manfred Lorenz - Catastrophe Crow!’s notoriously enigmatic director - has long-hinted he’s been making something perhaps more akin to Mystthan a kid-friendly platformer, remarking that “games are made of code, but they also are codes. There must be a gap, and a leap of faith between player and designer.”</p>
<p>Perhaps he’s just being pretentious, or you’ll be unraveling this mystery with us when the game comes out this Christmas…</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="../images/image105.jpg" width="250" /></p>
<p>The cogs and machines make this no cliché lava level.</p>
<p>And where would we be without a cute snow world?</p>
<p>Hop up high to get some great level-spanning vistas, with barely any fog or pop-up in sight!</p>
<p>¹ “Crow” instead of “Mr. Crow” and a singular they.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Interview Transcript</p>
<p>Nintendo has high hopes for Catastrophe Crow(see page 40). The brainchild of German codeshop Opus Interactive, it proved to be the surprise Nintendo 64 attraction at this year’s Spaceworld event. But is this really Europe’s answer to Super Mario 64? And can it compete? Edgespoke with Opus Interactive’s founder Manfred Lorenzduring the show.</p>
<p>Edge: When did work start on Catastrophe Crow?</p>
<p>ML: I had been wanting to enter the world of true 3D for many years, but didn’t know my starting point for some time. The, one day, my daughter spontaneously sketched a character - a hapless crow with a bandaged wing - and my vision suddenly became clear. The entire company was set to work on Catastrophe Crowby January 1996.</p>
<p>Edge: What design objectives did you start with?</p>
<p>ML: When one begins thinking about working in 3D, one makes the mistake of thinking there are ‘six’ degrees of freedom: above, below, left, right, in, and out. In computer terms, that is perhaps correct, but to the player the actual feeling of movement and freedom is nearly infinite. I needed to do justice to that feeling. So while we will grab the players with the action and playforming, the larger design must allow players to truly explore. In truth, I believe what we are creating beyond a game - perhaps a portal of sorts. In Catastrophe Crowone can explore our worlds but also explore within...finding meaning within the gameplay. The Crow is the cleverest animal, so the mind must be required throughout.</p>
<p>Edge: Does this relate to the ‘eternal revival system’ you mentioned? Could you tell us more about that?</p>
<p>ML: [Laughs] A little. The thought began with the idea of Game Overs - which are now fossils from the coin-ops and nothing more. Now that the player is presented with a real world they wish to explore and solve, having lives and dying felt too cruel. So we created something else. Something where, in the event you die, your soul remains constant, but the world around you inevitably changes. I confess this element is still a work in progress.</p>
<p>Edge: How do you think the project compares to other big 3D platformers, NiGHTSand Super Mario 64?</p>
<p>ML: I think that many months ago three teams set out to create their vision of a 3D platform game. Miyamoto-san went free-roaming, Naka-san¹ went for the feeling-of-flight. And Manfred Lorenz tried to enter the 3D realm and neve [sic] come [sic] back! [Laughs] Were these three games on the same platform, I think there would be less competition between them. I think Mario 64is brilliant. However, I don’t think it resembles the oldMariogames in execution. NiGHTSwas fun as well. But it definitely was not an attempt by Naka-san to create another Sonic. Like Mario, I think NiGHTSis an excellent game… but it wasn’t a platformer in the strictest sense. And both, if I am honest, are missing some ‘truth’. When we eventually release Catastrophe Crow, I am unsure if it will be considered a platformer at all. Our goal has always been to push the boundaries of player experience. Catastrophe Crowis built on a freedom of movement but also a freedom of thought.</p>
<p>Edge: On that point, are there going to be a lot of puzzles in this game?</p>
<p>ML: I think ‘puzzles’ is the wrong word. Instead, I have always thought of games as the ultimate expression: one in which the player ‘lives through’ the experiences of the creator.² Since the first cave painting, there has been an impossible-but-crossable gap between the audience and the artist. Like two points made of rock or stone - a precipice with no bridge between. To put it another way: games must be made of code, but they also are codes. There must always be a gap, and a leap of faith between player and designer.³</p>
<p>Miyamoto-san went free-roaming</p>
<p>Naka-san went for the feeling-of-flight,</p>
<p>We will enter the 3D realm</p>
<p>And never come back...⁴</p>
<p>Edge: The game sounds like it’s exploring some fascinating ideas - is the story first written in English or German? What is your process there?</p>
<p>ML: English, I like to keep a bilingual household. Indeed, I encourage my entire team to speak and code in English when working on Catastrophe Crow. Of course, we will localise in German and French and Italian etceteraonce we are close to release, but for now this is how we work. As long as English remains the primary root of computer code, it must also be the mother tongue of games.</p>
<p>Edge: What has been the toughest thing to get working properly?</p>
<p>ML: Creating my vision...at 30Hz.⁵ We were certain from day one that dropping below that refresh rate would destroy the immersive experience - and destroy the portal, as it were. It took six months to get the code strong enough so we could run the number of polygons we needed, with the texture bit-depths we wanted, and never drop below 30 frames per second. We began with enticing but near-empty environments - I enjoyed the peace and tranquility, but knew they must soon grow in scope and scale, populated with thinking, breathing characters⁶ and unexpected transformations. Thus, my programmers have fought the speed problem throughout the entire project, but continue to win out. We keep hearing murmurs from within the industry that Opus Interactive have been using ‘dark arts’⁷ on our hardware to achieve the look we have. This is simply untrue. We believe there is yet more to squeeze out of the Nintendo 64.</p>
<p>Edge: How do you see the development of 3D platform games progressing?</p>
<p>ML: I think simulating the third dimension is going to add a new dimension to all life experience [sic]. I think Mario 64was just the beginning. And I think there is a lot to be explored in that direction. And while I have great memories from the SNES days, I also believe that the classic style of 2D gaming is dead. Now, half of our jobs as designers is to learn how to mourn and move on...or choose not to.⁸ Of course, we grew up on Mario, and Mr. Miyamoto’s innovations and design expertise are nearly unmatched in the industry. I want to reiterate that nothing I have said in this interview should be taken as criticism of anything in Mario 64. Miyamoto-san continues to produce quality [sic]. And it’s clear he really loves the medium. At E3 I watched him play Catastrophe Crow. He was completely absorbed from the moment he touched the controller. I think that is a powerful sign.</p>
<p>Edge: How much longer do you see the development of Catastrophe Crowtaking? Staff have politely talked about your ‘perfectionism’ - at what point do you have to say ‘enough’?</p>
<p>ML: I confess I get very absorbed in my projects. Such that time feels of little consequence to me. My producer has given me a Christmas 1999 release and I am at peace with that...for now. It is a good time for a release. It would be great for my daughter to see the fruits of my labour, and her own design, on Christmas Day. But I contest that the idea of ‘perfectionism’ is a false one. There is either ‘finished’ or ‘not’. ‘Art’ or ‘trash’. To put it bluntly, the portal either works or it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Edge: What are your plans after this?</p>
<p>ML: I cannot imagine anything afterCatastrophe Crow.</p>
<p>¹ Japanese honorifics. Strangely, Miyamoto is referred to as “Mr. Miyamoto” later in the interview, before switching back to “Miyamoto-san.”</p>
<p>² A good indication that even before Manfred’s breakdown, the game was already somewhat of a reflection of his life.</p>
<p>³ This was quoted in the N64 Future Look scan, indicating that this interview was made before that.</p>
<p>⁴ Looks like Edge paraphrased Manfred a bit.I don’t think Edge really understood what Manfred was saying in this interview, considering how little follow-up questions they ask. You have a notoriously eccentric developer saying strange things and you don’t think to ask for clarifications?</p>
<p>⁵ “30 Hz,” or 30 frames per second an unusual choice of wording since PAL is normally 50 Hz or 50 frames per second. However, actual frame rates on the N64 can vary wildly, sometimes struggling to hit 30 fps. The Nintendo 64’s CPU (93.75 Mhz) and graphics (62.5 Mhz) are greater. Awake Human brain waves are about 30 Hz, however, so perhaps he’s not referring to frame rate?</p>
<p>⁶ “Thinking,” perhaps an indication of attempts to program complex AI?</p>
<p>⁷Taking “dark arts” literally has been wonderful fodder for our theorists.</p>
<p>⁸ Odd choice of words.Perhaps Thea had already died when this interview was made?However, that would contradict the later statement “It would be great for my daughter [to see the release] on Christmas Day.”</p>

<h3 id="grounds">Grounds<a class="headerlink" href="#grounds" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>First seen at 2:00 in What Happened to CROW 64? and is prominent throughout the videos. </p>
<p>The Grounds is a grassy valley with a path between a house (called “Home” in this document) and an office building labeled “Work”. Bushes, flowers, and butterflies are placed throughout, a prominent natural archway stands above the path between Home and Work, but the two parts of the arch do not meet. In Forest Level, the skybox changes to a pyramidal shape.</p>

<h3 id="work-building">Work Building<a class="headerlink" href="#work-building" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>An office building with large text saying “WORK” in front of it. In the back there is a vent leading to a secret puzzle area. On top is the key to the Vigenère Cipher. Inside are portals in the form of computers to the Toy and Forest Levels. It has five stories.</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="../images/image91.jpg" width="400" /></p>
<p>In the interview, there’s a screenshot of the Grounds at night, with street lights leading up to the Work Building.</p>

<p>First seen briefly at 1:29 in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? and later much darker in Forest Level. Pyramids are notably tombs in real life. It has not been explored on video thoroughly yet. The hieroglyphs, “𓇳𓅃𓋹” (sun/N5-falcon/G5-ankh/S34) above the gate translate to “may Re live.” The other symbols may have some meaning as well.When it appears at the end of Forest Level and in the Workstation Dump, it has green highlights instead of pink.</p>
<ul>
<li>NewTotem_Boat appears to be blank at first glance, but is actually an image of a boat or basket, possibly the hieroglyph 𓎟 (basket/V30.)</li>
<li>NewTotem_Cat looks a lot like a pentagram missing a line, but it has not been identified as of yet.</li>
<li>NewTotem_Crow has what appears to be a halo.It does not match any hieroglyphs.</li>
<li>NewTotem_Eye is the Eye of Horus (D10.)</li>
<li>NewTotem_Water is similar to but different from the hieroglyphs 𓈖 and 𓈗 (ripple of water/N35 and three ripples of water/N35A), but appears closer to the Aquarius symbol (♒︎.)</li>

<p><img alt="Image" src="../images/image128.gif" width="400" /></p>
<p>First seen at 2:00 in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? This level is grassy and decorated with gigantic toys, specifically letter blocks, a chess set, and a teddy bear. Jaunty music plays, but it gives way to blowing wind as Mr. Crow ventures away from the “normal” play area. A large platform of letter blocks is above it, but it cannot be seen from the ground.</p>
<p>Contains chess pieces as enemies. These pieces remain on the chessboard, guarding some silver coins.</p>
<p>The letter blocks change between visits, <span style="color:red"> possibly a subtle product of the Eternal Revival System. </span></p>

<p><em>Bandage Crow refers to Mr. Crow and Small Crow refers to Brother Crow</em></p>
<p>First seen at 2:09 in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64?, and then multiple times after. Accessible on the second floor of the Work Building. Multiple notable events in the videos occur here, such as the stair-falling incident, suggesting that this forest has some importance to the Lorenzes and may represent a real location.The Forest Level is a forest with thick fog, and contains, among other things, a bridge area, a well, a grave, Crawler, and the same stairs that appear at Home.</p>
<p>In the screenshot included in the Planet 64 scan, Mr. Crow is standing in front of a large out-of-place door, which has not been seen yet on video. In addition, there are multiple indications (Planet 64 scan and 2:09 of WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64?) that Monks were present in the level at some point, but they have not been seen on video.</p>

<p>A bridge with Flying Fish jumping over. It appears at 2:09 in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64 and again in Let’s Play Catastrophe Crow! 64 - Ep1. In its first appearance, the bridge is straight, but in the let’s play it is constructed of letters. <span style="color:red"> It’s possible that these are two different bridges, since the coast is closer and more parallel in the first appearance. </span></p>

<p>Where the Lorenzes lived during the public development of Catastrophe Crow. Cuxhaven is a small coast town in the north of Germany. It is a popular tourist destination and historically was a major fishing wharf for Hamburg. Important note:while the house used as the Lorenz house has been located, the actual real house is almost certainly not intended to play a role in the ARG. Please do not bother the people who live in it.</p>
<h4 id="hambug">Hambug<a class="headerlink" href="#hambug" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Where the office of Opus Interactive was. Hamburg is a large historically, culturally, and financially significant city in northern Germany. Hamburg is one of three cities in Germany that are part of their own Bundesland (state).</p>
<h4 id="schwarzwaldblack-forest">Schwarzwald/Black Forest<a class="headerlink" href="#schwarzwaldblack-forest" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>A large forest in southern Germany, near the border with France. A candidate for the holiday location due to being the most notable of the German forests, but its size likely means that if the holiday location is here, it needs to be narrowed down further.This area is considered for the Lorenz holiday location due to being forested and having tourist attractions.</p>
<h4 id="bispingen-wilseder-berg">Bispingen &amp; Wilseder Berg<a class="headerlink" href="#bispingen-wilseder-berg" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The eBay auction listing for the development cartridge was as being in Bispingen. It is a small municipality known for being a popular vacation destination. It is about 52 kilometers (32 miles) south of Hamburg. It contains a nature reserve, the Wilseder Berg, which is populated by heather and more loosely by trees. </p>
<h4 id="vallombrosa">Vallombrosa<a class="headerlink" href="#vallombrosa" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Vallombrosa is a summer resort in Tuscany, Italy. It lies within a forest, and contains a nature reserve. It is a tourist destination. </p>
<h4 id="laurentum">Laurentum<a class="headerlink" href="#laurentum" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Important ancient but now unpopulated town in Lazio, Italy between Ostia and Antium (Anzio.) It was regarded as the original capital of the Latins. The Villa of Pliny the Younger is located in its former location. It’s the origin of the “Lorenz” family name. Unlikely to be the holiday location on account of no longer existing.</p>
<h4 id="helgoland-wattensee-islands">Helgoland &amp; Wattensee Islands<a class="headerlink" href="#helgoland-wattensee-islands" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Islands in the North Sea. Notably many are connected to ornithological (bird) study and conservation and two are tourist destinations. </p>
<p>The Lorenz holiday destination is possibly Helgoland or Neuwerk, considering their proximity, tourist attraction, and connection to birds, and considering that the latter three islands are neither readily open to the public nor have facilities for a holiday, but are mentioned here for completeness.</p>
<ul>
<li>Helgoland (German) or Heligoland (English) is a pair of islands of historical and cultural significance. They lie 69 kilometers (43 miles) from Cuxhaven. It is both a vacation destination and an important location of ornithological study.</li>
<li>Neuwerk is a small island 13 kilometers (8 miles) from Cuxhaven, and can be reached on foot during low tide, making it a popular tourist spot. It has a population of 32.</li>
<li>Nigehörn/Nigehoern is a tiny island 15 kilometers (9 miles) from Cuxhaven. It has been a bird sanctuary since 1989, but public visits are prohibited starting at an unknown time.</li>
<li>Scharhörn/Scharhoern is an even smaller island 15 kilometers (9 miles) from Cuxhaven. Public access is forbidden with the exception of tours. It serves as a bird sanctuary.</li>
<li>Sylt (too far north to be on the map above) is an island off the western coast of Schleswig and is a jet ski tourist destination. It’s about 119 kilometers (74 miles) from Cuxhaven.</li>
<li>Trischen is a small island about 22 kilometers (14 miles) from Cuxhaven. It is only populated from March to October by a bird warden as it is part of a national park. Many birds visit throughout the year</li>

<p>At 2:50 in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64?, a tester mentions that “there was something in the game [that] was not [Manfed’s] intention.” What was it?</p>
<h3 id="what-was-the-meaning-of-manfreds-note">What was the Meaning of Manfred’s Note?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-the-meaning-of-manfreds-note" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>We don’t have much insight into the meaning of his note.</p>
<pre><code>“We've both done what we thought was right” While we have an idea of Manfred’s actions, we know next-to-nothing of Marta’s.
“You took from me. And I to You.” Why is “You” capitalized? What was taken?
“I have - finally - gone home.” What does he mean by home?
</code></pre>
<h3 id="where-is-marta">Where is Marta?<a class="headerlink" href="#where-is-marta" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Marta left Germany 6 months before Manfred’s disappearance. It’s unclear if she is missing, but her motives for leaving Germany and current circumstances are unknown to us.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-the-ringing-phone-mean">What Does the Ringing Phone Mean?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-does-the-ringing-phone-mean" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>A ringing but unanswerable phone appears multiple times, including notably before Mr. Crow falls down the stairs. What does it mean?</p>
<p>Appearances:</p>
<ul>
<li>WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? at 8:30 in the Work building.</li>
<li>WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? at 11:00 before Mr. Crow falls down the stairs.</li>
<li>At Forest Level at 2:00 when Mr. Crow returns to the office.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-are-the-creatures">What are the Creatures?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-creatures" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The creatures, in particular Scarecrow and Crawler, seem to have some importance. Are they AI generated? Human created? Supernatural? What are their intentions? Scarecrow and Crawler are commonly speculated to represent Marta and Nils respectively because of their appearance in Catastrophe Crow N64, but why do those people also get crows representing them? And why would they be represented as monsters?</p>
<h3 id="what-is-sir-cat">What is Sir Cat?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-sir-cat" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Sir Cat, despite being stated as being the main villain of the Catastrophe Crow game’s plot has not appeared in person yet. His only presence so far is with the “catanic circles.”</p>
<pre><code>Is Sir Cat a metaphorical/literal demon?
Is he keeping Manfred from passing on?
Why the Satanic reference?
Why was there a catanic circle around Father Crow coding in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64?

<h3 id="what-exactly-is-the-eternal-revival-system">What Exactly Is the “Eternal Revival” System?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-exactly-is-the-eternal-revival-system" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>For such a unique and important mechanic, we know so little about it. Supposedly it changes the game after each death, but we haven’t seen much of its capabilities. It has effectively no presence in the workstation dump aside from the start up sound. In addition, howdoes this system work, especially on the Nintendo 64? And is “Eternal Revival” even the correct translation?</p>

<p>For the sake of readability, this section will not be marked. Keep in mind all of the following are theories and speculation created by the community. Theories are listed loosely in order of likeliness, from most to least. This list isn’t comprehensive due to the nature of ARGs encouraging theory-crafting, and thus this section focuses on those that haven’t been covered elsewhere in the document.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="mr-crow-fell-down-the-stairs">Mr. Crow Fell Down the Stairs<a class="headerlink" href="#mr-crow-fell-down-the-stairs" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Current consensus is that the person Mr. Crow represents was injured by falling down the stairs. However, it’s uncertain when this occurred (before Thea’s drawing or during development), and if this fall was fatal.</p>
<pre><code>Mr. Crow falling down the stairsin WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? Is the main evidence for this.
</code></pre>
<h3 id="magnum-opus">Magnum Opus<a class="headerlink" href="#magnum-opus" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>“Opus Interactive” may be a reference to the alchemical concept of the “Magnum Opus,” or “Great Work,” a substance that can convert common metals to gold, rejuvenate, and grant immortality. Taking this concept and applying it to Catastrophe Crow, there are two trains of thought:</p>
<ul>
<li>Literal:After the death of Thea Lorenz, Manfred Lorenz dedicated the development of the game to making her “immortal” by coding an AI in her image, taking advantage of the “Eternal Revival” system’s dynamic capabilities. This process might include more traditional occultism too.</li>
<li>Figurative:After the death of Thea Lorenz, Manfred Lorenz dedicated the development of the game to making something that would honor her memory, and projected her image and life story onto Mr. Crow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following the train of thought of the literal interpretation of this theory, the red circle of pawns in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? is a decagram, a twice repeated pentagram used in Hermetic alchemy, each point representing an emanation of the Sefirot. The Sefirot, or “Tree of Life,” is a Talmudic Jewish and Hermetic alchemist belief that God has 10 emanations through which He can be communed with. However, this symbol is fairly uncommon in comparison to other symbols.</p>

<p><img alt="Image" src="../images/image65.jpg" width="400" /></p>
<p>The videos may contain different builds of the game, or at least the game altered through the eternal revival system. BMB from the Discord attempted to make a timeline of these builds.</p>

<h3 id="adermanulrich-is-run-by-manfred">@AdermanUlrich is Run by Manfred<a class="headerlink" href="#adermanulrich-is-run-by-manfred" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>While Ulrich Aderman is (in universe) a real person, the Twitter account by his name may actually be run by Manfred instead. Original theory by bird <a href="https://discord.com/channels/766502010504871936/766784143185936414/787029110462480384">here</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why does Ulrich have the workstation?</p>
<ul>
<li>If he stole it for preservation, why wait until now to act on that?</li>
<li>If he stole it for personal use, wouldn’t some if not all Catastrophe Crow files have been deleted to make space?</li>
<li>If he stole it out of spite, why would he still have it and not have sold it?</li>
<li>An at home workstation seems unlikely, since Manfred’s perfectionism and controlling nature makes it unlikely that he would allow work outside the office.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Circumstantial Evidence</p>
<ul>
<li>The last email before December 5th from M L was on October 21st, and on October 22nd Ulrich Aderman’s Twitter was created.
 On November 7th, Ulrich responded to a question from Paradox Factor on Twitter, apologizing by saying he was traveling. In the days prior, _ (Oct 29) and _ (Nov 4) were uploaded, two videos interpreted as Manfred waiting for Nils.</li>
<li>Why would Ulrich have the development documents? Not too out there, but still strange that he would keep 20 year old documents.</li>
<li>Any explanation of why Ulrich has the workstation has issues. Manfred, on the other hand, is explicitly noted as having taken all the development hardware when he disappeared.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-phone-ringing-represents-manfreds-absence">The Phone Ringing Represents Manfred’s Absence<a class="headerlink" href="#the-phone-ringing-represents-manfreds-absence" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The ringing phone represents Manfred’s absence from his family as he grew more obsessed with working on Catastrophe Crow. When Thea fell down the stairs, he ignored calls from Marta, which is why the phone can’t be answered. Alternatively, it represents Manfred avoiding his home life, including Thea’s injury.</p>
<h3 id="catanism">Catanism<a class="headerlink" href="#catanism" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Sir Cat is mentioned in the scans as the villain of the game’s “bizarre plot,” but the only reference to him found in the Unity dump is these “Catanic Circles.” Combined with the fact his name sounds remarkably similar to “circuit,” perhaps Sir Cat is a malevolent entity, possibly AI. Notable is the fact one of the few catanic circles found thus far was connected pawns around Father Crow coding.</p>
<h3 id="manfred-lorenz-is-trapped-in-the-game">Manfred Lorenz is Trapped in the Game<a class="headerlink" href="#manfred-lorenz-is-trapped-in-the-game" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Somehow, Manfred Lorenz has gotten himself trapped in the game. Doubt has been cast on this theory as Manfred was trying to meet up with Nils in the real world unless he got trapped in the game and then later freed.</p>
<pre><code>“And Manfred Lorenz entered the 3D realm and never come [sic] back! [Laughs]”, a quote from Manfred in the Interview scan.
“I am in Hell, one of my own making”
</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-stairs-are-symbolic">The Stairs are Symbolic<a class="headerlink" href="#the-stairs-are-symbolic" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Instead of a literal staircase accident, the stairs represent a sudden decline in Mr. Crow’s condition.</p>
<h3 id="dna-chart">DNA Chart<a class="headerlink" href="#dna-chart" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><img alt="Image" src="../images/image24.jpg" width="400" /></p>
<p>The texture that appears after Mr. Crow falls down the stairs and in Let’s Play Catastrophe Crow! Ep. 1 after encountering Crawler resembles a DNA chart</p>
<h3 id="lightning-struck-mr-crow">Lightning Struck Mr. Crow<a class="headerlink" href="#lightning-struck-mr-crow" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>As can be seen in the original drawing and in one of the drawings in the children’s room in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64?, Mr. Crow has been struck by lightning, suggesting that the person he represents was struck by lightning in real life. Supporting this is that the brain scan flash looks like a flash of lightning.</p>
<h3 id="seizures">Seizures<a class="headerlink" href="#seizures" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Seizures can be compared to a lightning storm, and Mr. Crow falling down the stairs also resembles a seizure. Plus, the brain scan images appear when he tumbles. However, it should be noted that seizures in real life typically aren’t this dramatic, and the seizure imagery is just coincidental.</p>
<p>Tying into the lightning theory, it’s possible Mr. Crow experienced a lightning seizure, a momentary and abrupt loss of consciousness combined with spasms. Lightning seizures also can cause long term brain damage or even death</p>
