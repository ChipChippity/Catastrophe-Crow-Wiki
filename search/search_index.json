Quote: \u201cGot this letter today (!). Surprised Opus exists in any shape or form tbh, but they seem to have some future plans\u2026 Watch this space! #CatastropheCrow\" On the note it thanks Adam for bringing Opus\u2019s title Catastrophe Crow! to a wider audience via his youtube channel. It seems like Opus is aware of Adam\u2019s documentary video, as proven by the letter. It\u2019s unknown if the letter actually spells anything or if it\u2019s just lorem ipsum, although below Adam\u2019s hand you can see a word that spells out \u201cprovide\u201d. It\u2019s interesting to note that the youtube post and the twitter one differ, on youtube one instead of \u201cWatch this space!\u201d it\u2019s \u201cWill keep you posted!\u201d. GET READY..! \u00b6 September 7th, 2023, Adam Butcher uploaded a video on his channel called \u201cGET READY\u2026!\u201d. The video features a distorted main theme of Crow 64, with what seems to be Mr. Crow spinning to face the viewer. Description \u201cIt\u2019s more than just a toy, it\u2019s the beginning of an adventure!\u201d Video credit: Opus Legacy Co. If you paid close attention to the left part of the screen, you could see some weird pixel column pattern. Extracting the image you get this: The date says 05.10.23 This is presumably the date The ARG returns, or seeing Crow 64 plushie here that starts funding on the same date.. (The Plush has been funded As of November 3rd, 2023.) It\u2019s official, because it was created back in July of 2023. You can also find Opus Legacy on Twitter . They have uploaded the exact same video on their channel. It is unknown what they\u2019re trying to tell us, but they do follow Ulrich Aderman, Ultra 64 Forever and Adam Butcher on twitter, so it\u2019s possible that they are other former employees Very interesting to note it\u2019s not Opus Interactive as how it used to be, it\u2019s now called Opus Legacy for some reason. It\u2019s possible Opus is trying to make some kind of comeback or something else, but there is no clear evidence or clues as to why, how, and who. WHERE ARE THEY...? \u00b6 September 21st, 2023, Opus Legacy uploads a video on their channel called \u201cWHERE ARE THEY\u2026? (Catastrophe Crow Toy Advert)\u201d, a minute after, the video also lands on Adam Butcher\u2019s channel. The video promotes a new Makeship plushie featuring Mr. Crow. The date 05.10.23 is when the funding launches, and production starts on October 27th, 2023. Estimated shipment date is January 20, 2024. Both the Opus Legacy and Adam Butcher videos are different. Click here to see both videos played at the same time. Differences \u00b6 Cartridge \u00b6 At 0:05 the cartridge zooms in. Important to note that the serial number on the cartridge is very different from Nintendo ones. The part below seems to spell NWTC-OPHAC, which from Crow Language translates to \u201cCANT-EXIST\u201d. Jigsaw First Appearance \u00b6 At 0:06 you can see a weird code, similar to one seen in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? when Adam launches the game. Work building Windows \u00b6 At 0:07, for a brief moment (few frames), right after the jigsaw puzzle, you can see that some of the work building windows are blacked out. It\u2019s important to consider that blacked out windows have already been used for solving one of the puzzles in ARG. This is very similar. Members of the community were able to put out numbers from the blacked out windows: 38, 51, 31, 35, 4 or 385131354 (put together). This will be used to solve The BASE64 Puzzle later! Makeship \u00b6 Makeship is a company that makes marketable plushies. On the official link to the Crow plushie Look Closely, Some of the letters are not what they seem they spell out \u201cresurrection\u201d or taken from the website \u201c\u027e\u1eb9\u1e63\u1ee5\u027e\u027e\u1eb9\u010b\u1e6b\u0130\u1d11\u1e45\u201d. This will be later useful to unlock the Itch.io Page for The Catastrophe Crow game. On October 5th, The makeship plushie finally got revealed and funding started. CATASTROPHE CROW! PLUSH - Available now! \u00b6 On October 5th, 2023, two new videos got posted again. One by Adam and one by Opus. They are almost identical, and the Opus one only has one difference. We\u2019ve got some new looks at the Catastrophe Crow plushie. This is probably just an advertisement to advertise the plushie. Resurrection is back \u00b6 Around 0:06 an odd sound appears. Reversing it you can hear the word \u201cResurrection\u201d being spoken. Click here to download and listen. Coins UI and Controller Pattern Puzzle \u00b6 Starting from 0:07 the controller appears on the screen. Looking in the right bottom corner you can see the coins ui. This current frame says 00. Around a second later, an almost identical thing appears, but now with 01 in there. Another second later, we can now see this. Here are all the numbers listed here, in order of appearance: 00 00 01 06 00 02 04 00 01 00 06 05 02 03 Now come the controllers. There seems to be a pattern in the way the buttons are pressed, too: First Frame: A Second Frame: R-button Third Frame: D-pad Top Left: START + A + D-pad Top Right: Control Stick (Circular Motion) + START + D-pad Bottom Right: START + C-button + D-pad Bottom Left: START + B The chronological order of buttons pressed is as follows: A-button \u2192 R-button \u2192 D-pad \u2192 START \u2192 Control Stick (Circular Motion) \u2192 START \u2192 START \u2192 A-button \u2192 START \u2192 C-button \u2192 B-button \u2192 D-pad \u2192 L-button \u2192 D-pad Let\u2019s use the method used in \u201cController cipher / Crow Language #6\u201d in the entire Crow64 Known Info document in order to translate these buttons into letters. Analog stick \u27a1 Follow the motions, they draw a letter D-pad \u27a1 D Start button \u27a1 S A/B buttons \u27a1 A/B Analog C buttons \u27a1 C Left shoulder button \u27a1 L Right shoulder button \u27a1 R The sequence of letters is as follows: A R D S O S S A S C B D L D The coin count is used to move letters forward by their assigned number. E.G: Let's take the number 1 and letter X, this means you have to move X by one in alphabetical order, thus making it Y. Now, let's take the coin count and connect them with the letters. There are enough numbers for each letter. Letters Numbers A 0 R 0 D 1 S 6 O 0 S 2 S 4 A 0 S 1 C 0 B 6 D 5 L 2 D 3 The end result becomes: AREYOUWATCHING New gameplay \u00b6 Around 0:18-0:20, new gameplay can be seen. Mr. Crow is walking into a tunnel next to the computer. This is a level from the video Catastrophe Crow! \u2013 Underground Level . This tunnel never appears in the unity project, or even in any of the videos. Differences \u00b6 Jigsaw Second Appearance \u00b6 Unlike in previous videos from Opus Legacy\u2019s version, a lot was changed. In this video\u2019s case though, there's only one major difference, and that is the second half of the Jigsaw puzzle. The Unscattered image: On The Top it Says BWCROI which translates to FATHER from Crow language Going Top to bottom, there is: 11 38 19 11 17 15 23 24 21 22 14 13 18 21 13 * Letters per line It\u2019s worth noting that we have SOME words to work along with, that were deciphered over the course of each video being released, those being: RESURRECTION - 12 letters WEAREINHELL - 11 letters AREYOUWATCHING - 14 letters Return of Ulrich Aderman \u00b6 On October 8th, the Twitter account of Ulrich Aderman retweeted the second Opus Legacy Co. plush ad that contained editing differences compared to the original YouTube advertisement. \u201cI suppose they secured the rights. I may get one after all!\u201d It has been confirmed through a reply to ParadoxFactor that Ulrich doesn\u2019t know who bought the rights to Opus, nor is he connected to anyone involved in the company\u2019s comeback. It is worth noting in his reply to Miles that he is retired. He spends most of his time with his family and dogs. These replies are possible confirmation that Ulrich Aderman is not a sockpuppet account of Manfred\u2019s, as previously theorized. Catastrophe Crow - Huggable, squishable! \u00b6 On October 12th, 2023, we got another new video. As always, one by Opus and Adam . The differences aren\u2019t major again, everything is partially the same. Though there is some interesting things in both of them. Butterfly Pattern \u00b6 From 0:05 to 0:07, butterflies can be seen flying. They are shaped in a form of a letter, and there are 11 frames with butterflies, so 11 letters. Spying eye \u00b6 At 0:08 Mr. Crow is about to enter the WORK building. At the last remaining frames an eye can be seen looking out. New gameplay #2 \u00b6 This looks like a desert level, with a weird figure that Mr.Crow is Approaching This is likely The Scarecrow , since The head fits The money bag form, and is also t-posing. Jigsaw Third Appearance \u2014 OPUS LEGACY \u00b6 Manfred is back \u2014 Adam Butcher \u00b6 At 0:16 plushie version of Manfred is seen standing in what appears to be an attic. It\u2019s worth noting that Manfred\u2019s plushie doesn\u2019t have a bandage, unlike the original Crow does, suggesting that someone had to manually remove the bandage off of the plush. Brightned up \"FINAL DAYS!\" (official catastrophe crow advert) \u00b6 On October 19th, 2023, Adam Butcher and Opus uploaded another advert to promote the plush. For the first time both versions are IDENTICAL and there is not any differences in it spotted at ALL. ### Odd forest Some shots of an odd forest appear in the video. It\u2019s unknown if it means anything. Controller pak \u00b6 At 0:34 we are shown what appears to be a controller pak of Crow 64. Purpose is unknown. Might be indicating the release of the playable build for CC64. Crawler \u00b6 Right before the Base64 image appears, there are weird pixels seen all in a random order. A few frames later, a scattered image of Base64 also appears, which actually is a hint that we need to place them all in place again. This is technically a jigsaw puzzle #2. What appears to be Crawler from CC64 crawling up to the camera. Crawler always represents Nils in the original run, so take that in mind. Base64 Image \u00b6 For a few frames, a weird shot of what appears to be an image encoded into Base 64. There are a lot of weird red looking things. These are ankh images we got from the previous arg run. In the subtitles of the TikTok video and YouTube video on the Opus Legacy pages, the ankhs are represented by @ signs. There are 9 ankhs in the images, and there are also 9 numbers found from the new building binary puzzle. Thus, inserting each of building numbers into the ankhs in order results in: 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 Up-Scaled: The background of this image has weird colors. If we refer back to WHERE ARE THEY? advert, the colors match those seen in that video. Which uncovers an Itch.io page Catastrophe Crow! Official Game on itch.io \u00b6 Using the Base64 image and colors that matched to letters in the WHERE ARE THEY? video, we were able to find a link to the official CATASTROPHE CROW! game on itch.io . It was password locked with The password being RESURRECTION Release date \u00b6 In the old 05.10.23 image, weird dots are seen. If you take the row of each pixel treading the bottom row as zero and counting upwards, they decode to 051023, the same release date shown on the image, 05/10/23 (October 5, 2023). Oddly enough, these dots are also seen in the newest base 64 image. If you do the same thing with the new cartridge image you get 260424, or 26/04/24 (April 26, 2024). This is presumably the official release date of the Catastrophe Crow! game. The plushie is \u2013 funded! \u00b6 On October 23-24th, 2023, the plush finally gets funded (reaches 200 sold), which means everyone is getting their own plush now! \u2014 A final message from Opus Legacy Co. \u00b6 On November 3rd, 2023, a new video was uploaded both to AdamButcher\u2019s and Opus Legacy\u2019s channel. Teddy bear toy returns \u00b6 From timestamp 0:00 to 0:05, and 0:07, a teddy bear plushie can be seen transforming into the Mr. Crow Wind-up key puzzle (Keyboard puzzle) \u00b6 Opus Legacy\u2019s video has the same clip, but the noise is different. The noises in the background are the keyboard noises that were seen in Catastrophe Crow! \u2013 Underground Level video . Turning the noise from the audio into letters, we get a phrase: I W A I T E D High-res look at the Base64 cartridge \u00b6 In Opus Legacy\u2019s video version, around from 0:13 to 0:14, a cartridge image faintly appears. It\u2019s the same cartridge image we got from the Base64 image puzzle, but high resolution. It\u2019s unknown if there\u2019s any emphasis on it. ## Conclusion So concludes the Recap for now. There are a lot of things to find, decipher, and wait for. I suggest you keep an eye out and join the discord server which is where a lot of stuff is being found through. I recommend you to check the puzzle doc to keep up with what has been deciphered and whatnot.

Whats This? \u00b6 This document is created and updated by members of the Catastrophe Crow community to follow the alternate reality game centering on the eponymous game. ARG? An alternate reality game, or ARG, is a story that claims to be real and features audience interaction, sometimes interacting with the real world. \u201cCatastrophe Crow!\u201d, or \u201cCrow 64\u201d is a fictional game developed by Manfred Lorenz and Opus Interactive for the Nintendo 64. Opus Interactive went under, the game got trapped in development Hell, and until recently, Manfred Lorenz was believed dead. Adam Butcher\u2019s research and resulting video \u201cWHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64?\u201d brought attention to this game, and community has formed around documenting its peculiarities and the events surrounding it. Warning! To be clear, Catastrophe Crow, Manfred Lorenz, and the events surrounding them are completely fictional, but this document will generally discuss them as if they were real for convenience. Adam and Luke Butcher are real individuals who have done a multitude of work outside of Catastrophe Crow. In addition, while there are interactable elements, please use caution when interacting. We do not want to accidentally bother individuals not connected to the ARG.There is a real company named Opus Interactive, but it is completely unrelated to the Opus Interactive of Catastrophe Crow. This document aims to do the following: Document the game Catastrophe Crow and the story around it Research and explain their oddities Collect the research in an easily accessible manner Known Ciphers \u00b6 An online C# decoder is available for both of the text based ciphers, usage should be fairly self explanatory: simply change the parameters for functions like CrowTranslateFrom or CrowDecipher. Link to decoder here . Crow Language \u00b6 Some text that appears in the game might appear garbled / nonsensical, this is most likely due to it being in \u201cCrow Language.\u201d catastrophe crow n64 playthrough by N64 Long Lost Lore includes the Pause screen both pre-garble (at 0:30) and post-garble (at 3:00), using these two bits we can build a map between the regular alphabet and the Crow alphabet. Letters not present in this screen have been deduced over time by filling in the blanks when deciphering various messages. Latest letter map (top is ciphertext, bottom is plaintext): A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z S F T Z L Q U I R V Y O J C E X M H W N P B A D K G For example, if you start with the word \u201cpassword,\u201d you would replace each letter with a letter from the top row as seen in the table below. The result is \u201cUWAASLIX.\u201d This can then be decoded back into \u201cpassword\u201d by replacing each letter from the top row with one from the bottom row, or in other words doing the same process in reverse. Interestingly, \u201cThea\u201d encodes to \u201cCrow,\u201d \u201cCrow\u201d encodes to \u201cNils,\u201d and \u201cNils\u201d encodes to \u201cThea\u201d in Crow Language. An easy online converter can be found here . Vigenere Cipher \u00b6 In case a series of digits is stumbled upon, it\u2019s most likely that it can be used to decode into another piece of text. One such series can be found in the video WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? by AdamButcher (at 4:22). The table for decoding text that uses this cipher appears in Forest Level by N64ExcavationMan (at 3:38). Series of digits are used as values for the Y axis while repeating characters of a keyword, all of which so far being a person\u2019s name are used for the X axis. Currently discovered functional keywords are Nils, Thea, and Crow. Deciphering Example Digits: 30781354841 Name: NILS For the first letter of the result, take the letter from row 3 column N, then row 0 column I, etc. In most cases the name will be shorter than the amount of digits, in that case just keep repeating it. The \u201cfull name\u201d for the above cipher can be understood as NILSNILSNIL. After deciphering we get the result NILSIMALIVE. Keyboard Sound Cipher \u00b6 In Catastrophe Crow! \u2013 Underground Level by Childhood Memories 64 from 0:49 onwards, the Crow steps on various keys on a computer keyboard. Each sound corresponds to one letter. Using these sounds, one can map audio cues in videos like Video back to Crow Language and then to regular words. A soundboard with all the individual sounds is available here . The first letter of a sound\u2019s name often corresponds to the keyboard letter that makes it. For example B for Bell, P for Phone, etc. Ocean Quest Cipher \u00b6 Notes Letters C3 A C#3 B D3 C D#3 D E3 E F3 F F#3 G G3 H G#3 I A3 J A#3 K B3 L C4 M C#4 N D4 O D#4 P E4 Q F4 R F#4 S G4 T G#4 U A4 V A#4 W B4 X C5 Y C#5 Z Characters \u00b6 Human Characters \u00b6 Manfred Lorenz \u00b6 Pronounced [man.fr\u025bt l\u0254.r\u025bnts] (maan-fret lau-rents) The illustrious creator of Catastrophe Crow and Ocean Quest and lead programmer at now-defunct Opus Interactive. Noted perfectionist, and receiver of two Golden Joysticks and an AIAS Hall of Fame Award. Late in development of Catastrophe Crow, his home life had fallen apart and he had not seen his family for months. In the final months he was the final and only developer on the project as all other staff members were let go. Believed to be dead after his disappearance off of Cuxhaven. He left a cryptic note to his wife that said, among other things, that he had finally gone home. Recent email correspondence with a \u201cM L\u201d suggests he is still alive and aware of the search around Catastrophe Crow. The names of the channels can also be merged together to form his name, and M L comments about them confirm that M L created them. Retrogamingcollectibles, the eBay seller who sold Adam\u2019s cartridge, is believed to be Manfred and intended to sell the game to Nils,but Adam bought it instead.

His current whereabouts are unknown. He isn\u2019t mentioned once in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? Adam Butcher \u00b6 A youtuber, writer, and director who helped create WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64?, the video which started this community.

Possesses game develop documentation and an old workstation from which he dumped the rom for the game. He\u2019s been oddly quiet since doing so, not replying on Twitter for over a month. Crow 64 Characters \u00b6 Mr. Crow \u00b6 The protagonist of the game. Has typical platformer skills, including ledge grabbing, wall jumping, and a triple jump aided by his wings. Due to an injury, he is unable to fly, and his left wing is held in a bandage. Generally agreed to represent Thea Lorenz. His name is given as \u201cMr. Crow\u201d in the Planet 64 scan, but simply as \u201cCrow\u201d in N64 Future Look. As the first was from 1997 and the second from 1999. His name is given as \u201cMr. Crow\u201d and gender as male in this document for the sake of clarity. Thea\u2019s drawing gives his name as \u201cKatastrophe Kr\u00e4he [sic]\u201d, which is German for \u201cCatastrophe Crow.\u201d it is possible that his name was officially changed between the two articles. This could also suggest that Manfred had begun to project Thea more onto Mr. Crow Evidence supporting Mr. Crow representing Thea: She created the original design for Catastrophe Crow. This is only for your little brother now.\u201d from Keyboard Cipher #1 suggests that TheaLorenz is dead. In Crow Language, \u201cThea\u201d becomes \u201cCrow\u201d. Dead Crow appears in a room that has Thea\u2019s original Catastrophe Crow drawing, which also suggests that Dead Crow is Thea. Brother Crow \u00b6 The Brother Crow appears in Let\u2019s Play Catastrophe Crow! Ep. 1 and Forest Level after Mr. Crow interacts with the mirror in the Forest Level. Unlike Mr. Crow, he is missing the bandage on the right wing, has green eyes, and is also shorter. Unlike Mr. Crow, he is able to fly, with no apparent limit seen so far, allowing him to travel to parts of levels that Mr. Crow is unable to reach. Almost certainly a separate character from Mr. Crow, and possibly the same character as Crawler. He is believed to represent Nils Evidence supporting Brother Crow representing Nils: horter than Mr. Crow, paralleling how Nils was shorter than Thea Father Crow\u2019s comment about how \u201cyou always looked alike\u201d in Let\u2019s Play Catastrophe Crow! Ep. 1. If Thea is Mr. Crow, then it follows that Nils\u2019s representative looks like Thea\u2019s. \u201cNils\u201d in Crow Language decodes to \u201cCrow\u201d in plaintext. Inside the Unity project he is called \u201cBrother Crow.\u201d Father crow \u00b6 A glasses-wearing older crow, presumed to be the father of Mr. Crow. No official name known. Briefly becomes the player character at 11:26 in WHAT HAPPEND TO CROW 64 until the end of the video after Mr. Crow falls down the stairs. He also jumps off his boat earlier in the video. General consensus among the researchers is that he represents Manfred Evidence supporting the Manfred=Father Crow Theory: Father Crow jumpingoff a boat with computer equipment in WHAT HAPPEND TO CROW 64, paralleling Manfred\u2019s disappearance and presumed death in the North Sea. Is the only worker at the \u201cwork building,\u201d and is apparently a programmer. Is a father, like Manfred. Fits in with the general consensus that Mr. Crow represents Manfred\u2019s child. Wears glasses, like Manfred. Dead crow \u00b6 What appears to be a heavily injured crow, found at the end of WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? Dead Crow is also the Crow that appears most like a real-life crow, ignoring the missing head. Possibly represents Thea Lorenz, and may be the same as Mr. Crow since Dead Crow only appears when Father Crow is the played character. Notably appears in a room that has Thea\u2019s original drawing. Missing head Perhaps the person it represents had a head injury? Creatures \u00b6 Various NPCs featured in Catastrophe Crow. Their names are as below, listed from left to right. Scarecrow Crawler Monks Flying Fish The Trees Scarecrow (who first appeared at 7:50 in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64?) and Crawler appear after Mr. Crow falls down the stairs and approaches him. The bags over their heads are called \u201cmoney bags\u201d in the Unity Dump. The family photo in Catastrophe Crow N64 suggests that they represent Marta and Nils respectively. Crawler also bears resemblance to Scarecrow. Monks appear in the Planet 64 scan, 2:09 in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64?, and briefly at 0:45 in Video. They appear in both a large (about five times Mr. Crow\u2019s height) and small (about five times Mr. Crow\u2019s height) sizes. The Flying Fish appear in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? at 2:08 and Let's Play Catastrophe Crow! 64 \u2013 Ep1 starting at 1:58. In contrast to real fish, which have vertically oriented tail fins, the Flying Fish have sea mammal-like horizontally oriented tail fins. The Trees appear in \u201cCatastrophe Crow!\u201d Development Documents and turn to face the player. Their eye is called EvilEye in the Workstation Dump. Sir Cat \u00b6 The original intended villain of the game. He has not made an appearance in any of the videos or scans. His name sounds a lot like \u201ccircuit.\u201d The only reference to him in the Unity files are the \u201cCatanic Circles\u201d found in Toy Land\u2019s directory. Pawns \u00b6 Appears briefly in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? and \u00b0 (Nov 23). Considering the \u201ccredits\u201d scene from the workstation dump they are believed to represent Opus Interactive\u2019s employees. Teddy Bear \u00b6 Appears most prominently in Let's Play Catastrophe Crow! 64 \u2013 Ep2, \u00b0 (Nov 23), and \u00b0 (Dec 5), where it gives a code. In the workstation dump it\u2019s called \u201cplayer,\u201d suggesting that it represents the player, whether that be players of Catastrophe Crow in-universe, the participants of the ARG, a specific individual such as Thea or Nils, or some combination of those possibilities.The fact is is replaced briefly with Brother Crow and a Pawn in \u00b0 (Nov 23) leads credence to the idea that Teddy Bear represents more than one thing. It may have a second meaning as it is a repeated prop E-mails \u00b6 Email Censoring M L\u2019s email has not responded. Stop emailing it. Stop asking about it. Whatever you are thinking has already been done twice over. Do not try to extract private information from it or hack it. Irresponsible activity is why we can\u2019t have nice things. A handful of the channels contain made up e-mail addresses on their About page.

At around 8 AM UTC on 17th October, the address began responding with replies such as \u201cWho is it?\u201d. The emails were shown to come from an M L. After replying with \u201cNils,\u201d user Medley (Mikel) received the following response: After replying, it appears the emailer wants to know Nils\u2019 birth date and location where they holidayed each year. So far the date Nov 5th is confirmed as incorrect for the birth date. This date was guessed from the dates listed on the front of the prototype cartridge in the documentary video. The locations Cuxhaven and Bispingen/Wilseder Berg also appear incorrect. The guess of a forest in Italy, presumed to be Vallombrosa, has not been confirmed as right or wrong. Given the initials of ML and responses it appears this is Manfred Lorenz looking for Nils for an unknown reason. He also set up at least the four Youtube accounts that the email address used as well as the initial eBay auction. Email Transcripts \u00b6 This is transcripts of all emails that have received replies from ML. Attempts made that did not receive a reply are not recorded below as without a reply there is no information on ML to be added.. Nils Three reply variations have been received. The first from user Medley (Mikel) ML: Nils\u2026 Is this really true? *Replied back to ML that it was. ML: My dearest boy, After all these years I have much to say, Your birthday is not too far from now. I hope we can meet the day after? In the place we holidayed every year? I will be there. M A reply was made with Nov 5th as the birthday, and Cuxhaven and Bispingen/Wilseder Berg as the holiday locations. ML: I wish to believe you, but can no longer make the leap. I understand now that this has met many more eyes then those for which it was intended. I can only hope the true recipient is among them I will be waiting The second was from user Sr Esteban. 10/18 8:52 AM CST N: I have so many questions... first of all.. Is this really you? 10/18 9:48 AM CST ML: My dearest boy, I so wish to believe it is you, To have come this far, you must understand me somewhat. But there is much to discuss. I hope we can meet? I have been thinking the day after your birthday, in a place we holidayed every year. I will be waiting. M 10/18 12:34 PM CST N:I want to meet! Its been so long\u2026 and I was young the last I knew you. A lot of repressed memories. Could it be the forest in Italy? 10/18 3:09 PM CST ML: I am sorry. I want to take a leap of faith...but the chasm grows ever wider. There are too many prying eyes, I need proof you are who you say you are, You would not have forgotten your birth date. M A reply was sent stating November 5th for the birth date. ML: Another imposter. I can only hope that he wishes to remember me. And that among the prying eyes he is one of them. Until then, I will be waiting. The third was sent by user 7k. This was sent from an account showing the name Nils L. and was attempted to ask questions preemptively of ML for additional information. 10/18 8:29 PM Nils L: I feel like I\u2019m losing my mind. Is this real? Are you trying to contact me? 10/19 6:46 AM M L: Is this truly Nils? Are you out there, reading this somehow? Or have you chosen not to remember me? 10/19 1:37 PM Nils L: Well my name is Nils Lorenz, I was born in Germany where I lived when I was really young, and my father was a game developer named Manfred, I even distinctly remember the Crow character, but my father died when I was very young. At least that\u2019s what my mother always told me. I\u2019ve been seeing these videos of this incredibly familiar game, with strange messages that seem like they\u2019re aimed at me, but I\u2019m unsure what to think of it. I don;t know how to feel about this situation and I don\u2019t know if I can trust you. I feel like I\u2019m dreaming. Is there anything you can do to clear this up for me? Is there anything you can tell me so I know it\u2019s you? Something from my childhood. Where did my sister go to school? Where did we vacation. What was our house like? 10/19 ML:You speak like him, as I imagine he would. With questions painful to answer. But the imposters multiply, I feel I cannot take another step. All I can do is wait. Perhaps it is just a little longer. 10/20 10:49 Nils L:I guess that\u2019s understandable, but know I am being honest. This whole situation is gnawing at the back of my mind, and I\u2019ve been struggling with how to handle everything. I\u2019d like answers. But if you feel unsure I understand, as I feel the same way. Take as much time as you need. I will be here. Waiting. 10/21 M L: I see us standing on either side of the chasm. Neither alive or dead. But the gap only grows wider. We have all waited too long. It is the cruelty Marta Sent by user ParadoxFactor. This was done to help determine if M L was Manfred or Marta 10/17 4:48 PM PST ML: Who is this? 10/18 1:31 PST Marta: It's Marta. 10/18 12:58 AM PST ML: I doubt that very much. 10/18 9:24 PST Marta: It is me. I saw the video online and had to reach out. 10/18 2:22 AM PST ML: My doubt remains. She never solved anything. 10/18 11:09 PST Marta: Your right. Nils solved it but didn't want to send a message. So I am instead. 10/18 7:34 AM PST ML: That is possible... But there can be no intermediary. After all these years, you would still not understand. Manfred Sent by user Vicky. Initial message indicated they were lost Lost Soul:What are you trying to tell me? ML:What do you mean? Kaleb, a video game enthusiast K: Hello, my name is Kaleb, growing up my favorite genera of game was the 3D platformer and the genre still remains in a special part of my heart today. I\u2019m always looking for a classic platformer I haven;t played yet, so when a game I never heard of stared popping up in my recommendation box it instantly got my attention and I was intrigued to find out that these videos had hidden messages in them. You may have seen some of my comments on some of the videos picking apart their puzzles. I now realize that while these videos are public these messages weren\u2019t intended for everyone. But still, I am touched by your story from what I can make of it. So if there is anything I can do to help please let me know. ML: Kaleb, Perhaps in another life we would have been friends But this remains a private matter. Your help would be of no use to me. M K: Fan art A previous employee of Opus Interactive Sent by user Rainbow 10/18 1:06 AM PST ML: Who is this? 10/18 10:01 AM PST Employee: this is one of Opus Interactive\u2019s previous employees. 10/18 1:12 PM PST ML: Then all I can say is I am sorry. Fred Daves, a YouTuber playing Catastrophe Crow Sent by user Flamsy to look like they are connected to the YouTube channel 90sRetroGamingFRed Fred: Hey I heard you are the creator of a game called Catastrophe Crow! 64. I\u2019m playing it on my channel, and I am having a blast! Fred: Hey\u2026 mind if I ask you a few questions? The game is acting a bit\u2026 strange. ML: \u201cFred\u201d Whatever I create I can no longer control. A concerned father Sent by user Sir Dibs. He sent in as his own account not posing as anyone else. The title of the email was Crow64 Sir Dibs:I have heard about your desire to meet with your long lost son Nils through others. As a father, I understand this desire and would like to offer my help in finding him. I fear your proposed meetup may not have reached him. Is there anything you can tell me about Nils to help me locate him and get your messages to him? I apologize for the invasion of privacy but your message seems urgent and many are concerned. ML:There has been a grave mistake. The game you mention is unreleased. It is not meant for you. N64 Long Lost Lore Sent by user prlennox. This is the name of one of the Youtube channels with videos of Catastrophe Crow 64. N64LLL: Hello, I'm \"N64 Long Lost Lore\"! I've been recently playing one of your games (Catastrophe Crow) on my channel and it's been pretty fun! It reminds me of numerous other platformers, yet it's bigger and better than them. I've been looking into the company you managed and worked on the game (Opus Interactive) and I found another game you worked on, \"Ocean Quest\". Another channel like mine uploaded a song from the game. I'm curious if you have any more information on it, since I was quite fascinated by Catastrophe Crow. So if you don't mind, could you share some details with me? Thanks! ML: And \u201cLore\u201d Another creation running by itself N64LLL: Someone was recently selling a development of Catastrophe Crow on the site ebay.com 2 weeks ago. For details, it had a label with numerous dates on it on the bottom, and it had \"CROW\" written in sharpie on the top. I was about to buy it but someone bought it before me, right after I discovered the Ebay page, to be exact. But here's a screenshot I took before they bought it. A screenshot of the eBay auction from the documentary was included. Would you happen to know information about who bought it, or the seller? Really just any information you happen to know about the cartridge sold on Ebay? If so, please share the information with me! Thanks! ML:So he never received it... It is all so long ago now. Long lost. 10/19 Mr QuartzSent by user SirDibs. Was sent to see the reaction if offered help in locating Nils. Mr. Q: I have heard about your desire to meet with you long lost son Nils through others. As a father, I understand this desire and would like to offer my help in finding him. I fear your proposed meetup may not have reached him. Is there anything you can tell me about Nils to help me locate him and get your messages to him? I apologize for the invasion of privacy but your message seems urgent and many are concerned. 10/19 ML:Mr Quartz - If he does not wish to remember me, I do not wish to be remembered. I will remain here. MM Sent by user Medley (Mikel) MM: Dear M L, We are trying to help Nils get in touch with you, does he have access to all the information he needs to try and meet up with you? Or does he need to wait longer to prove himself? Thanks, MM ML:I wish your help was of use to me. If only it were so simple. It is the cruelty of unfinished things Email silence and mass reply from ML \u00b6 From October 21st to December 5th, no replies were received from ML, despite many email attempts. After a Discord user attempted to access the account via a password reset, the email address was removed from this document. On December 5th, a wave of emails was sent out as the Unity project file from Ulrich was cracked. Everyone up to then who had emailed ML, regardless if he had previously replied to them, received an identical .wav filetitled \u00b0. This file contained a coded audio message. When translated it created the image to the right. This was determined to likely be a pyramid. This image may have been intended as a hint at part of the password to access the Unity files. One of the keywords needed for the password was tomb and Egyptian pyramids were built for that purpose. Since this mass email, no further replies have been received from ML. Video Findings \u00b6 WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64 \u00b6 Unknown Floor \u00b6 At 1:05, one of the screenshots shows stairs with a blue carpet, something not seen in either of the floors of Work seen on video so far. \u9d09 64 \u00b6 At 1:27, the display uses the uncommon kanji \u201c\u9d09\u201d instead of the katakana spelling \u201c\u30ab\u30e9\u30b9,\u201d which is how it\u2019s spelled in modern Japanese and would also be a transliteration of the English word \u201cCrow.\u201d Note from The boat \u00b6 At 4:20 in the video, a death note from the game\u2019s lead developer Manfred Lorenz appears. The digits in this note can be used in the Vigen\u00e8re Cipher, depending on the Name we used for deciphering we can arrive at various results: Nils \u27a1 Nils I\u2019m alive Thea \u27a1 Is not for you Crow \u27a1 For other kin Manfred's last note translation (by Quinn) Marta, You were always in the right \u2014 and remain it till the last day. It's impossible to look into people's heads to decode their behaviour; to find out why we are so cruel to one another. We both did what we thought was right \u2014 and yet, we could accuse one another of insanity. You have only taken from me \u2014 and I from you. So the world can remain open, my path is set in place. I have \u2014 finally \u2014 gone home. -M Transcription Marta, Du warst immer im Recht \u2014 und bist es bis zum heutigen Tage. Es ist unm\u00f6glich in die K\u00f6pfe der Leute zu gucken, um ihr Verhalten zu dekodieren, und rauszufinden wieso wir so grausam zueinander sind. Wir haben beide getan, was wir f\u00fcr richtig hielten \u2014 und k\u00f6nnten uns gegenseitig des Wahnsinns bezichtigen. Du hast mir genommen. Und ich Dir. Damit die Welt offen bleiben kann, fixiert sich mein Weg.Ich bin \u2014 endlich \u2014 nach Hause gegangen. -M \u201cFixiert\u201d is also used to mean \u201cfixated,\u201d as in \u201cto be fixated on something.\u201d The phrase is oddly worded,meaning that this could have a double meaning. N64 Future Look \u00b6 Here we can see the lava and ice worlds briefly shown in Video Contradicting Planet 64, the main character\u2019s name is simply given as \u201cCrow\u201d here. \u201cThe more we explored, the more we\u2019ve got a sense of the game hiding something larger...cryptic clues in character dialog, a strange code found in forgotten corners of the levels, even a bizarre sci-fi pyramid filled with hieroglyphics.\u201d The Contradiction in Planet 64 perhaps hints to a name change in the 2 years that had passed? The quote indicates that even before the original release date, there were unusual elements in Catastrophe Crow. The sci-fi pyramid also sounds a lot like the area found at the end of Forest Level. Like Something was Following Me \u00b6 At 2:49, CCgefickt says that there were \u201cweird glitches like something was following [me],\u201d \u201ceven early levels were not working right,\u201d and that he had \u201cnot programmed for weeks,\u201d. The three developers posting on this unknown forum are \u201cdevAnonym,\u201d \u201cCCgefickt,\u201d and \u201cOpusKunst.\u201d \u201cGefickt\u201d is German for \u201cfucked\u201d and \u201cKunst\u201d is German for \u201cart.\u201d suggesting that even before the layoffs, programming was increasingly under the sole control of Manfred. Developer Cartridge \u00b6 At 4:58, a picture of a Catastrophe Crow dev cart is shown. The dates on the bottom arebelieved to be build dates, and are documented in the Timeline later in this document. On top is the label: \u201cNUS-16F32S 256M+256K.\u201d This means: NUS: cartridge requires the Jumper Pak (as opposed to the Expansion Pak games like Donkey Kong 64 used.) 16F32S: this is a prototype/developer cartridge. 256M+256K: this game operates with 256 MB storage. Crow Language Note Template \u00b6 At 5:30 in the video, before the game boots up, a template for a note written in Crow Language appears. The missing text is scattered within hints throughout other videos. Thanks to each line being a different length, piecing the note together once all the hints are found is straightforward. The line lengths are: 11, 34, 13, 10, 9, 14, 30, 15, 27, 24, 3, 33 The full note reads, with the filled in boxes bolded: Dearest Thea I am sorry I coul d not b e with you in the end I w a s too afraid I r an and now I am in h e ll One I made my s elf I dreamed of you playing t his one day But you n ever will Please forg i ve me my little crow P l ease forgive me both of you Dad This i s only for your little brother now In Crow: XOWIOACCROW HWQALIIKHNLGEXTLCVOSHCRKLGHTCROOTX HSWACLLWBIWHX HIWTWTXTLS HWQHTROEE LTOHQWXOQKAOEB HXIOWQOXLBKLGUEWKHTZCRHALTOXWK VGCKLGTOJOISHEE UEOWAOBLIZHJOQOQKEHCCEONILS UEOWAOBLIZHJOQOVLCRLBKLG XWX CRHAHALTEKBLIKLGIEHCCEOVILCROITLS The letters in the filled in boxes spell out \u201cDearest Nils\u201d He\u2019s Not Been Home in Days \u00b6 At 5:50, after the title screen, there is a brief image of text on a black screen, before transitioning to the Grounds. Jump Sounds \u00b6 At 6:07, as Adam begins to move around, Mr. Crow has a cartoonish \u201cboing\u201d sound when he jumps, and at 7:02 sounds also play with wall jumping. Father Crow Walks by \u00b6 At 6:20, Father Crow passes by in the Work Building. Mr. Crow follows him, leading to the Toy World portal, but Adam doesn\u2019t unambiguously remark on Father Crow. Graph Board \u00b6 At 6:27 in the video, a graph can be seen on the wall inside Work. The first time we see it, it has an upwards trend with a sticky note in top left. Later at 8:26, the same graph displays a downwards trend and has a sticky note in bottom right. This is relevant for Crow Language #4 . Still chess \u00b6 At 6:40, the chess pieces don\u2019t bounce or move about, but still rotate to face the player. Adam says \u201csorry, uh, I\u2019m not very good at talking while playing\u2026 so\u2026 I\u2019ll put in a VO afterwards.\u201d There also isn\u2019t any music playing in the level. The Stairs Appear \u00b6 At 6:56, the first appearance of the infamous stairs occurs. They aren\u2019t seen until Mr. Crow walks under an arch. The blocks next to the stairs are the only instances of letter blocks partially embedded in the ground. Second Meeting with Father Crow \u00b6 At 7:09, Mr. Crow wall jumps up to a platform not visible from the start. The camera pans past the boat with no remark from Adam. The letter blocks making up the floor have noticeable z-fighting where they meet with each other. Mr. Crow then sights Father Crow in the center of some bouncy pawns beaming numbers to a computer Father Crow is typing on. All are surrounded by a red catanic circle, on the ground. When he interacts with him, he responds with the first Crow Language code, and the game hangs. Vigen\u00e8re Cipher#1 \u00b6 At 7:27 in the video, the following numbers are seen on the monitor, being typed repeatedly by another crow. 5863010175329940. The same numbers can also be seen on the floor, being beamed from the pawns towards Father Crow. Here are the decoded variants: Nils \u27a1 Please remember me Thea \u27a1 This is for another Crow \u27a1 Message not for you Crow Language #1 \u00b6 At 7:37 in the video the text HWQHTROEE shows up, after translating from Crow we get \u201cI am in hell.\u201d Grounds Again \u00b6 At 7:50, after a brief flash to the Clock Monster at Home, Mr. Crow reappears in the Grounds as a short jingle plays. The first sighting of Scarecrow occurs, but he disappears as Mr. Crow approaches. After this disappearance, Father Crow appears and enters the Work Building. Entering Work Again \u00b6 At 8:16 when the Work Building is entered, notably lacking the circle cut transition, the framed image of that building that was in the lobby previously and the ambiance is missing. Mr. Crow goes the same way as he did previously, but the computer portal is also missing. The tile textures on the floor in that room are misaligned. At 8:30, the camera briefly cuts to a ringing phone in Manfred\u2019s office, which is lacking a computer and family photo. Mr. Crow jumps on the phone to no visible effect. At 9:08, as he returns to the lobby, Father Crow is seen moving through the wall, and Mr. Crow follows him at moves out of bounds. The jump and wall jump sounds disappear. Father Crow Drowns \u00b6 At 9:40, we see this scene of Father Crow carrying some computer equipment and jumping off a boat. Mr. Crow follows shortly behind, ending up in the forest area.zz Misaligned Stairs \u00b6 The stairs that appear at 10:30 do not match their environment, clip into the terrain, and the final step goes above the level they\u2019re going to. These are the same stairs that appear at 12:00 in Home. Mr. Crow Falls Down the Stairs \u00b6 At 10:40, Father Crow is weeping over an open grave, with a tombstone with the name \u201cCROW\u201d. The player attempts to jump into the grave, but fails. A phone rings, Mr. Crow moves a little forward, and the game glitches out as he falls down the stairs. At 11:07, the textures briefly change to brain scans before Mr. Crow falls down the stairs. Two creatures approach before the screen cuts to black. This is used as the strongest evidence that whoever Mr. Crow represents was injured or killed falling down the stairs. Perhaps a ringing phone had something to do with this incident, which is why it\u2019s a recurring element. Glitched hub \u00b6 At 11:27, Father Crow appears in the Grounds, now as the player character. The textures are corrupted (e.g., teddy bear textures on the road) and a distorted version of the Kid World\u2019s music plays. The flower patches are z-fighting with themselves, the archways textures the CROW gravestone, and the bushes\u2019 texture is replaced with a skull face. Off the hook \u00b6 At 11:59, the phone\u2019s receiver is off the hook. There\u2019s a light buzzing during the cutaways to Home reminiscent of a phone off the hook, suggesting that this detail is important. Child's Room \u00b6 At 12:40, multiple drawings can be seen on the wall as Father Crow approaches Dead Crow. The drawings are, clockwise starting from furthest right: Two adults and two children. The Lorenz Family.The fourth individual has an oddly white face. The drawing that inspired Catastrophe Crow. A doctor, Mr. Crow, and an MRI machine.Mr. Crow is being struck by lightning. Possibly says \u201cAlter (age) 7.\u201d Mr. Crow in a wheelchair getting struck by lightning. Mr. Crow is carried on a stretcher by two individuals. On the floor is a toy boat, chessboard, a teddy bear, and letter blocks, just like in the Kid World. After the camera pans to Dead Crow, the room begins to flood. This room likely belongs to either Thea or Nils. Catastrophe Crow N64 \u00b6 House and Family \u00b6 The house is framed on the wall. A family of four is framed on the desk. When Mr. Crow walks away from it, the photo transitions to Father and Mr. Crow alongside Perhaps this is the Lorenz family and this is a depiction of Manfred Lorenz\u2019s office? Scarecrow and Crawler, suggesting that those creatures represent Marta and Nils. Morse Code Computer / Crow Language #2 \u00b6 This computer emits a repeating morse code which decodes to LTOHQWXOQKAOEB . ._.. _ _ _ _ .... _ . ._ _ .. _ _ _ _ . . ._ _ _ _ . _... ._.. _ _ _ _ After translating from Crow Language, we get \u201cOne I made myself.\u201d Dead End Hall \u00b6 After encountering the computer, the hall changes so that it is dead ends with that computer at both ends. Video \u00b6 Father Crow Jumps \u00b6 Mr. Crow runs up the arch and jumps into Father Crow, who is mirroring the former\u2019s movement. Doing this, Mr. Crow is teleported above multiple otherwise unseen levels and falls through them. The first is a lava level, the second a snow level, the third a test level, before finally landing in a cave. A Monk can be seen moving through the torii arch in the snow level. Embedded Props \u00b6 From 1:00 onwards, the player passes a number of props embedded in the walls of the cavern, and an image of a daytime sky briefly appears thrice. Reviewing the Unity file the objects are, in order: Roof, walls and window of upper part of the yellow house Roof and part of the walls of a corner of the yellow house Tipped over vase on an end table Hutch/buffet with a blue bowl on top. Bookcase Grandfather clock A pink armchair A phone and handset. End table Wooden high back chair Hutch/buffet Door This is roughly the same order of objects passed at Home at the end of WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? Keyboard sounds #1 / Crow Language #3 \u00b6 From 1:17 onwards, the player collects what looks like letter/number block collectibles, contrasting to the silver coins seen elsewhere. Each of them makes a specific noise. These match the Keyboard sound cipher . After mapping the sounds to letters, we get CRHAHALTEKBLIKLGIEHCCEOVILCROITLS . Translating that from Crow, we get \u201cThis is only for your little brother now.\u201d Four crows \u00b6 Within the cavern, three crows are briefly encountered. Two of them are larger than Mr. Crow, and one of them is the same size or smaller. Perhaps the Lorenz Family? However, Mr. Crow moves away from them, preventing a closer look. Below is the same scene from the rom. Catastrophe Crow! \u2013 Underground Level \u00b6 This video is the origin of the Keyboard sound cipher . This video has VHS distortion. suggesting that it is one of the oldest videos on the playlist. Crow Language #4 \u00b6 From 0:49 onwards the player steps on various keys on a computer keyboard, some of them lighting up with a green color. All the green inputs produce UEOWAOBLIZHJOQOVLCRLBKLG . After translating from Crow, we get \u201cPlease forgive me, both of you.\u201d Once the first correct letter of the Crow text is typed (U) a 10 minute timer starts, its purpose is unknown. A possible explanation is that this is a timer to solve the puzzle, and the intended audience was Thea, who was injured, and the long timer was to accommodate that. The computer resembles the one used to access the Kid World. catastrophe crow n64 playthrough \u00b6 This video is the origin of \u201cCrow Language\" Crow Language #5 \u00b6 At 0:53 in the video, the Graph board can be seen -- various letters are now in place of the graph. The sticky note position here matches the downwards trend graph from the original video. If we overlay the graph on top of the letters, the text HIWTWTXTLS is revealed. Translating from Crow, we get \u201cI ran and now.\u201d Dancing Chess \u00b6 In contrast to WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64?, the chess pieces here are moving around the board, and can injure Mr. Crow. The pieces move as they would in chess. Drop Down \u00b6 At 1:45, Mr. Crow ledge crawls over to a path hidden under the Kid World. Upon entering the building on the path, he is taken to a dark area. Opening the pause menu reveals that it has been translated to Crow. There is a large object, perhaps a teddy bear,but it cannot be seen fully.This was used to help decipher Crow Language by the players. This area might be a darkened version of the bedroom. cc64 menu \u00b6 This video has VHS distortion. suggesting that it is one of the oldest videos on the playlist. Home is Missing \u00b6 Missing Home Mr. Crow turns around, but Home is missing. Controller cipher / Crow Language #6 \u00b6 The focus of this video is a Controller Test screen. If we closely follow the inputs being made on the controller, a message encoded in Crow language can be found: HSWACLLWBIWHX , which translates to \u201cI was too afraid.\u201d Text on image says: TESTING >BACK To piece together the original message, interpret controller usage as follows: Analog stick \u27a1 Follow the motions, they draw a letter Start button \u27a1 S A/B buttons \u27a1 A/B Analog C buttons \u27a1 C Left shoulder button \u27a1 L Skull Headshot \u00b6 The sound that plays in the video was decoded to binary, then to base 64, and finally to an image of the face that appears on multiple of the creatures. Let's Play Catastrophe Crow! 64 \u2013 Ep1 \u00b6 Jump Sounds Return \u00b6 Jumping makes the same cartoonish sound as it did at the beginning of WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? No Family Photo \u00b6 At 0:34, the family photo on the desk is missing. It appears that the player is aware that it should be there .The chair swivels to follow Mr. Crow. Crow Language #7 \u00b6 At 0:50 a message in Crow Language is shown after the player attempts to speak to an empty chair. It reads HXIOWQOXLBKLGUEWKHTZCRHALTOXWK . Translation: \u201cI dreamed of you playing this one day.\u201d Forest Level Portal \u00b6 At 1:30, Mr. Crow jumps into a computer on the second floor, entering the Forest Level. Behind the computer is a painting. Perhaps there\u2019s portals to the Lava and Ice Levels on other floors? As there are five floors, this suggests there are five levels Crow Language #8 \u00b6 At 1:58 the player walks across a bridge that is in the shape of various letters. The message is VGCKLGTOJOISHEE . Translated: \u201cBut you never will.\u201d Collecting the silver coins here is silent. Slow drums play as background music. The bridge has a different texture than it head in the brief footage in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? Mirror Switch \u00b6 At 2:58, when Mr. Crow interacts with the mirror, the Crawler briefly appears, the camera cuts away twice to the same area that Mr. Crow was when he fell down the stairs, and when control resumes Mr. Crow is replaced with Brother Crow. Father Crow's Message \u00b6 At 3:53 a crow with glasses tells the player that they loved to count and sing their name round and round. This is rather similar to how one would use the Vigen\u00e8re Cipher, with numbers on the Y Axis and repeating letters of a person\u2019s name for the X Axis. Transcript of the entire message \u2026? You always looked alike\u2026 Of course I remember you You loved to count And sing your name Round and round Of course I remember you Let's Play Catastrophe Crow! 64 \u2013 Ep2 \u00b6 Interface Oddities \u00b6 There are jump sounds. When Mr. Crow goes near the vent at the back of Work, a B button prompt shows up, the only of its kind to appear. When he falls, he is respawned with no health. Crow Language #9 \u00b6 At 1:44 the player speaks to a teddy bear (which always faces the player strangely enough). The message box looks like pure noise but after fiddling with an image editor, a Crow language message can be revealed. It reads HWQALIIKHNLGEXTLCVOSHCRKLGHTCROOTX Translated: \u201cI am sorry I could not be with you in the end.\u201d Ankh Binary \u00b6 At 1:44, the odd audio that plays is actually binary code, decoding to a five by seven pixel image of an ankh. Catastrophe Crow!: N64 Gameplay \u00b6 This video has VHS distortion. suggesting that it is one of the oldest videos on the playlist. Musical Distortion \u00b6 The music slows down and distorts as time goes on. In addition, there\u2019s an odd percussion/tapping sound at 0:33 and 1:00. Dancing Chess \u00b6 In contrast to WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64?, the chess pieces here are moving around the board, and can injure Mr. Crow. Their moves are shown above on the right, and a static version of that image\u2019s frames can be found by clicking here Boat in the Distance \u00b6 At 1:08, Mr. Crow spots a boat collectible in the distance. He walks across an invisible path towards it as the music fades to blowing wind. After collecting it, the camera turns around to reveal a Crow Language message. Crow Language #10 \u00b6 At 1:40 a Crow Language message is in the letter blocks saying UEOWAOBLIZHJOQOQKEHCCEONILS, translating to \u201cPlease forgive me my little crow.\u201d Note that \u201cThea\u201d is \u201cCrow\u201d in Crow Language, \u201cCrow\u201d is \u201cNils\u201d in Crow Language, and \u201cNils\u201d is \u201cThea.\u201d No home \u00b6 At 2:03 Mr. Crow turns around after being teleported above the Grounds. The house is missing. Forest Level \u00b6 This video has VHS distortion. suggesting that it is one of the oldest videos on the playlist. In contrast to Let\u2019s Play Catastrophe Crow! Ep. 1, the silver coins have their usual jingle when collected. The Bandage Disappears \u00b6 At 1:00, after encountering Crawler, Mr. Crow is replaced with Brother Crow. Cartridge Tombstone \u00b6 At 2:04, Brother Crow comes across the grave, which has been filled in and lacks a tombstone. Over it floats a cartridge or tombstonecollectible, which Brother Crow collects. After doing so, he is transported back to the Grounds. Doffice \u00b6 At 2:18, when Brother Crow returns to Work, the lights have dimmed. The phone rings, but Brother Crow ignores it. Crow Flies High \u00b6 At 3:14, Brother Crow flies to the top of the work tower, finding a key collectible at the top. A droning sound plays in the background. When he collects the key, the Vigen\u00e8re Cipher key appears. Sky pyramid \u00b6 At 3:50, when Brother Crow looks up at the skybox, it is noticeably pyramidal. it appears that the Grounds is inside a pyramid, and the gate actually leads outside of it. Crow Flies away \u00b6 At 4:00, Brother Crow flies over the hills bounding the Grounds and lands on the skybox. In the distance there\u2019s a gate which he goes through, entering a dark area. This area resembles the Sci-Fi Pyramid area shown at 1:28 in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? Instead of the typical circle cut transition, it is instead an inverted pentagon. Its Manfred \u00b6 The sound playing in the Pyramid decodes to a bitmap image of Manfred Lorenz on his yacht. Small Drawing \u00b6 This appears briefly at 4:53, and decodes to the original Catastrophe Crow drawing, as seen on the left above. End Credits Soundtrack (1995) \u00b6 Ocean Quest This is, so far, the only video relating to Ocean Quest found. Thanks for Playing \u00b6 Using the above key from the first 26 tones in the video, the odd tones in this video decode to \u201cThea Nils Marta Manfred thanks for playing.\u201d Click here for a video explanation of the process, courtesy of Johnathan Rose-Lyon. _ (Oct 29) \u00b6 This video\u2019s title is simply an underscore, and a date is used here to disambiguate it. Still Image \u00b6 This video is a still image of the forest level, shown above on the left with a cleaned up edited image above on the right. A crow, the Unbandaged Crow judging by the lack of cast, can be seen in the distance, lightly obscured by the fog and facing away. The well can also be seen. It\u2019s possible that a yet-to-be deciphered Ocean Quest Cipher code is hiding in this video\u2019s audio. _ (Nov 4) \u00b6 This video\u2019s title is simply an underscore, and a date is used here to disambiguate it. Darkening Image \u00b6 Left: a still frame. Right: that frame brightened. The video consists of a still image, with darkness moving from the background into the foreground, until nothing can be seen. A crow, possibly Brother Crow but it is difficult to discern if there is a bandage or not ,looks at the camera while in the forest level. The audio is ambient crickets with faint tones translating to \u201cI remain.\u201d \u201cCatastrophe Crow!\u201d Development Documents \u00b6 The first video to be posted on a channel outside the original ones. Development Documents \u00b6 Images taken from the tweet made by Aderman on the same day, which are the same as the ones used in the video. View that tweet for larger versions. Document dated to March 2001, the month that Opus staff were laid off. Not all pages are given. Some German text, \u201cManfred, liest du das?\u201d appears on the first given scan, translating to \u201cManfred, are you reading this?\u201d Tree depicted with an eye. The first appearance of what was nicknamed by the community \u201cNightmarish Monster\u201d up close, with its name given as \u201cMonk.\u201d What was nicknamed by the community \u201cSkull Fish\u201d is depicted up close, with its name given as \u201cFlying Fish.\u201d The building appears to be binary. A typo can be found in the line \u201cForest irregular geometry\u201d with three letter rs. \u00b0 (Nov 23) \u00b6 Night Archway \u00b6 A binary code is played through sound after the \u201cspeech\u201d sound effect plays, decoding to a seven by five pixel image of a key, as shown on the right. This video shows actual gameplay, with Father Crow walking up the archway in the Grounds. On the other side is a teddy bear, which appears in a transformation starting with Mr. Crow, changing to Brother Crow, before settling on the Teddy Bear and below street lights can be seen. In the background is a dark cityscape not seen in the other videos. A frame before cutting to black, the Teddy Bear is replaced by a pawn. The video\u2019s tags are: \"all\", \"live\", \"on\", \"things\", \"somehow\". These tags are in the same order they were found in. \u00b0 (Dec 5) \u00b6 Teddy bear Binary \u00b6 Unity Key Crack This video dropped AFTER the community cracked the Unity dump. The video begins with Father Crow standing on the left side of the archway. Several seconds pass, and then the Teddy Bear appears, with the DIALOGUE START sound playing. A static code is then heard, which translates to 5x7 images of a pyramid and an ankh. Teddy Bear seems to float forward, and Father Crow leaps off the archway, meeting Teddy Bear in the air. The screen cuts to black. Ascend \u00b6 Father Crow is seen then rocketing upwards, through several stages of the game. An increasingly high-pitched sound plays while he does this, perhaps bits of ERS START. As he exits a final pyramid shaped texture, and enters a white void, ERS START is heard, though in a glitched manner. Father Crow then disappears, leaving the white void present until the video ends. The tags on this video are, in order: \u201cand\",\"feared\",\"have\",\"leap\",\"long\",\"so\",\"the\",\"you\". This, combined with the video prior, when rearranged, seems to spell out: \"All things must live on somehow, and so long you have feared the leap\". We have been given this message in email, by ML. With the tags given to us, the ERS START sound playing, and the model of Father Crow \u2018ascending\u2019, then disappearing, this video could signify Manfred exiting the game, alive, with the intention to locate Nils and take him into the game. Player interaction, represented by the Teddy Bear, could have freed him, and ERS START is what is played when the Eternal Revival System kicks in. \u201cCatastrophe Crow!\u201d Development Documents 2 \u00b6 A video version of a tweet posted by Ulrich Aderman Development Documents 2 \u00b6 Posts from @AdermanUlrich on November 29th , follow the link for the full version of each image. On the same day a video was posted to Aderman\u2019s channel. Third maze shown on page 04 was used in Let\u2019s Play Catastrophe Crow! Ep2. The letters are in alphabetical order, meaning thatmore likely than not there is nothing coded within them.Diagram on page 44c, \u201c1-bit Image Compression Algorithm,\u201d is a clue to using the binary audio cipher, which interprets binary audio as 1-bit information. Power Coins TBC on page 27 indicates that they have not been added, and the already seen coins are actually Silver Coins. The text on the other size of page 27 can be partially seen, revealing a partial moveset for Mr. Crow. The text is as follows: Page 27 Current Move Set Walk/Run Jump (Triple jump inconsistent?)

As of now, no other twitter accounts have been discovered and no responses have been received from this account. Banner \u00b6 There is faint text on the channel banner, but this is because it is an issue with scanning. It is present in the original scan from the magazine. Twitter Findings \u00b6 Profile Picture \u00b6 A derman\u2019s profile picture comes from this , an image of a SGI Octane\u2019s graphics board. Catastrophe Crow Documents \u00b6 Post from @AdermanUlrich on November 15th saying: \u201cAfter renewed interest in \"Catastrophe Crow!\", I found several documents from my Opus days. Maybe some of you find them interesting.\u201d Images were attached, as can be seen and discussed here , since they were identical to the contents of a video from Aderman. Development Hardware \u00b6 Post from @AdermanUlrich on November 19th saying: \u201cI have also retrieved this from storage. Unfortunately not powering on, I suspect several components need replacing. Keep you posted.\u201d The workstation pictured is an SGI Indy, a low-end system from Silicon Graphics, sold between 1993 and 1997. Although \u201clow-end\u201d, its specifications exceed that of the Nintendo 64. On the same day, Ulrich responded to one of the researchers giving advice on how to fix the SGI Indy. The images posted are edited pre-existing images, found here and here . Rom Drop \u00b6 Aderman posted a download of files found on the workstation . Included was an incredible amount of information and a non-functional rom file. Included are the following: A .rom file, or rather a password protected archive. Audio assets Image assets The letter blocks for \u201cHOME\u201d are commented Screenshots, including ones from the scans Catastrophe Crow Sounds \u00b6 Upon being given the password, Aderman then released a \u2018soundtrack\u2019 of sorts on archive.org . Included were the following: The main theme, two versions Individual instruments in the main theme Ambiance sounds Sound effects Two of these are of note. DIALOGUE MOTHERCROW is the sound that plays at the beginning of Crow gameplay in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? This absolutely confirms that it is Marta saying \u2018He hasn\u2019t been home\u2019. ERS START can be inferred to mean \u2018Eternal Revival System Start\u2019. This sound may play when ERS activates. This plays in a few spots, including several times in WHAT HAPPENED? and once, in a glitched state, in the video that was released on December 5th.

Phone Buzz Binary \u00b6 On four different occasions, there has been a clicking/whirring noise, possibly an encoded message , all playing when something unusual occurs. WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? at 9:50 when Father Crow jumps off the boat. WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? at 11:07 when Mr. Crow falls down the stairs. Catastrophe Crow! - Underground Level at 2:10 when Mr. Crow solves the puzzle. Let\u2019s Play Catastrophe Crow! 64 - Ep1 at 2:57 when Mr. Crow interacts with the mirror. Borrowed Textures \u00b6 Many of the textures in Catastrophe Crow are taken from Super Mario 64, some of them lightly edited. It is unknown if this was done for the sake of convenience for Adam and team, or if Opus Interactive in-universe took the textures. Ocean Quest Boat \u00b6 There is a boat model made by Westerly named Oceanquest 35 . It is unknown if this has a connection to the game. Thumbnail oddity \u00b6 The links on Google Docs for both _ videos have displayed an unusual behavior where their thumbnail and occasionally time listed differ from the actual video. This is not deliberate and is instead an unpredictable bug where the incorrect video is used for the embed, and multiple completely unrelated videos from things like a popular phone game or an Iranian musician have gotten their thumbnail displayed. Pictured above is an example of how it appears. The link otherwise works as intended. Merchandise Store \u00b6 There is an official merchandise store .So far nothing of note, aside from cool merchandise that you definitely should buy, has been gained from it. The User who Messaged Inside a Mind \u00b6 As mentioned in Inside a Mind\u2019s video on Catastrophe Crow , he learned of the game through a Reddit user messaging him claiming to be a beta tester. That user has since been identified, and based on their other posts meant as a beta tester for the ARG, not the fictional game. They have not replied to messages or made any posts since the start of the ARG. Scan Transcriptions \u00b6 Footnotes have been added with various observations, listed underneath each transcription separated with a horizontal bar. Planet 64 (1:05 in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64?) \u00b6 Stone the Crows! A surprise addition to the main presentation at Spaceworld was Catastrophe Crow, a game bearing more than a passing resemblance to Rare\u2019s own animal-related newie, Banjo-Kazooie.Its playing set-up will be comfortably familiar to most Mario-followers, with the eponymous \u2018Crow legging it around lushly-created 3D worlds and jumping on badguys\u2019 heads.\u00b9 The demo showed off all kinds of fluid moves from wall-jumps to hanging-off-ledges, but we suspect we\u2019ll never fly until we get that bandage off our wing\u2026 The slightly-hard-to-read Press Release promised \u2018fearless exploration of unfamiliar worlds\u2019\u00b2 and detailed a surreal plot about trying to save your father\u2019s business from a corporate takeover by the sinister Sir Cat. The company skyscraper appears to form a Peach\u2019s-Castle-style hub from which you access a range of unique-looking worlds, from a misty forest to a land of giant toys to some kind of mysterious Ancient Egyptian Spaceship thing-y. And while the format currently screams \u2018SM64-clone\u2019 the developers have promised something called an \u2018eternal revival system\u2019 to keep things changing every time you play. This will be the first N64-outing from Opus Interactive, a German developer helmed by director Manfred Lorenz, whose action-adventure Ocean Questwas a surprise late hit for the SNES. With an unconfirmed release date set not for another two years, we expect more information to come through rather slowly on this one. But considering Opus Interactive\u2019s lasting reputation for great gameplay and impressive world-building, we at N64can\u2019t wait to actually get our thumbs on it Mr Crow sure looks cute, even as he navigates a somewhat creepy block world. Is that a teddy bear looming in the mist?\u2074 Loads to explore, but I wouldn\u2019t trust those berries Flap! Woosh! With the help of some triple jump acroba-tics, going to work looks kinda fun! Scary monsters in the forest. Nightmarish!\u2075 Almost as strangely laid-out as our office\u2026 Those chess enemies move according to chess rules. Nice! \u00b9 No goomba-stomps have been seen in any of the videos. \u00b2 British styled quotes. This scan was probably originally published in Britain. \u00b3 This surreal plot hasn\u2019t been seen in video yet, and neither has Sir Cat. In addition, the parallels to Opus\u2019s own troubles can\u2019t be overlooked. \u2074 Notice the carpet, different from the grass seen in the videos, and the fog. \u2075 The door appears to be a modified version of the door used in Mario Party 2\u2019s Horror Land Board. N64 Future Look (2:00 in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64?) \u00b6 CATASTROPHE CROW! We\u2019ve had our beady N64 eye on Catastrophe Crow!For quite a few issues now. In development at Opus Interactive\u2019s Hamburg base for something approaching three years, it\u2019s a game that\u2019s looked consistently amazing in every screenshot we\u2019ve seen. When given the opportunity to play it for ourselves, we jumped at the chance. Visuals\u00b7The game brims with imagination and wonder, and, thanks to the expansion pak, is rendered in bright ultra-crisp detail. Based on a very strange storyline indeed, Catastrophe Crow!Consists of nine massive 3D worlds in desperate need of exploration. You play as the eponymous Crow, who runs head-first into their\u00b9 father\u2019s office to collect Power Coins and stop a corporate takeover by the evil Sir Cat. Much like Peach\u2019s Castle in Super Mario 64, this tower block serves as a hub-world to get you to each exciting new level - jumping appropriately into computer screens to explore the levels within. And explore we did. Because Catastrophe Crow!Is absolutely brimming with imagination and wonder. We\u2019ve clambered up giant teddy bears, sneaked around misty forests and hot-footed our way through a giant lava-powered machine. It\u2019s truly giving Super Mario 64and Banjo-Kazooiea run for their money in terms of world design. Of course, where comparisons are also going to be made is to SM64\u2019s move-set, which emphasises free-wheeling acrobatics over BK\u2019s more complicated-and-sometimes-clunky moves. We\u2019ve enjoyed flipping from triple-jumps to wall-jumps to hanging off ledges. If Crow\u2019s wing wasn\u2019t so adorably bandaged maybe we might even fly...perhaps an unlockable secret if we collect enough Power Coins. But while jumping on platforms and battling bizarre baddies is exceptionally fun, the few hours we\u2019ve spent with the game have slowly revealed a surprisingly deep and puzzle-y extra layer. The more we;ve explored, the more we\u2019ve got a sense of the game hiding something larger...cryptic clues in character dialog, a strange code found in forgotten corners of the levels, even a bizarre sci-fi pyramid filled with hieroglyphics. Manfred Lorenz - Catastrophe Crow!\u2019s notoriously enigmatic director - has long-hinted he\u2019s been making something perhaps more akin to Mystthan a kid-friendly platformer, remarking that \u201cgames are made of code, but they also are codes. There must be a gap, and a leap of faith between player and designer.\u201d Perhaps he\u2019s just being pretentious, or you\u2019ll be unraveling this mystery with us when the game comes out this Christmas\u2026 The cogs and machines make this no cliche\u0301 lava level. And where would we be without a cute snow world? Hop up high to get some great level-spanning vistas, with barely any fog or pop-up in sight! \u00b9 \u201cCrow\u201d instead of \u201cMr. Crow\u201d and a singular they. An audience with\u2026 Manfred Lorenz (1:38 in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64?) \u00b6 Interview Transcript Nintendo has high hopes for Catastrophe Crow(see page 40). The brainchild of German codeshop Opus Interactive, it proved to be the surprise Nintendo 64 attraction at this year\u2019s Spaceworld event. But is this really Europe\u2019s answer to Super Mario 64? And can it compete? Edgespoke with Opus Interactive\u2019s founder Manfred Lorenzduring the show. Edge: When did work start on Catastrophe Crow? ML: I had been wanting to enter the world of true 3D for many years, but didn\u2019t know my starting point for some time. The, one day, my daughter spontaneously sketched a character - a hapless crow with a bandaged wing - and my vision suddenly became clear. The entire company was set to work on Catastrophe Crowby January 1996. Edge: What design objectives did you start with? ML: When one begins thinking about working in 3D, one makes the mistake of thinking there are \u2018six\u2019 degrees of freedom: above, below, left, right, in, and out. In computer terms, that is perhaps correct, but to the player the actual feeling of movement and freedom is nearly infinite. I needed to do justice to that feeling. So while we will grab the players with the action and playforming, the larger design must allow players to truly explore. In truth, I believe what we are creating beyond a game - perhaps a portal of sorts. In Catastrophe Crowone can explore our worlds but also explore within...finding meaning within the gameplay. The Crow is the cleverest animal, so the mind must be required throughout. Edge: Does this relate to the \u2018eternal revival system\u2019 you mentioned? Could you tell us more about that? ML: [Laughs] A little. The thought began with the idea of Game Overs - which are now fossils from the coin-ops and nothing more. Now that the player is presented with a real world they wish to explore and solve, having lives and dying felt too cruel. So we created something else. Something where, in the event you die, your soul remains constant, but the world around you inevitably changes. I confess this element is still a work in progress. Edge: How do you think the project compares to other big 3D platformers, NiGHTSand Super Mario 64? ML: I think that many months ago three teams set out to create their vision of a 3D platform game. Miyamoto-san went free-roaming, Naka-san\u00b9 went for the feeling-of-flight. And Manfred Lorenz tried to enter the 3D realm and neve [sic] come [sic] back! [Laughs] Were these three games on the same platform, I think there would be less competition between them. I think Mario 64is brilliant. However, I don\u2019t think it resembles the oldMariogames in execution. NiGHTSwas fun as well. But it definitely was not an attempt by Naka-san to create another Sonic. Like Mario, I think NiGHTSis an excellent game\u2026 but it wasn\u2019t a platformer in the strictest sense. And both, if I am honest, are missing some \u2018truth\u2019. When we eventually release Catastrophe Crow, I am unsure if it will be considered a platformer at all. Our goal has always been to push the boundaries of player experience. Catastrophe Crowis built on a freedom of movement but also a freedom of thought. Edge: On that point, are there going to be a lot of puzzles in this game? ML: I think \u2018puzzles\u2019 is the wrong word. Instead, I have always thought of games as the ultimate expression: one in which the player \u2018lives through\u2019 the experiences of the creator.\u00b2 Since the first cave painting, there has been an impossible-but-crossable gap between the audience and the artist. Like two points made of rock or stone - a precipice with no bridge between. To put it another way: games must be made of code, but they also are codes. There must always be a gap, and a leap of faith between player and designer.\u00b3 Miyamoto-san went free-roaming Naka-san went for the feeling-of-flight, We will enter the 3D realm And never come back...\u2074 Edge: The game sounds like it\u2019s exploring some fascinating ideas - is the story first written in English or German? What is your process there? ML: English, I like to keep a bilingual household. Indeed, I encourage my entire team to speak and code in English when working on Catastrophe Crow. Of course, we will localise in German and French and Italian etceteraonce we are close to release, but for now this is how we work. As long as English remains the primary root of computer code, it must also be the mother tongue of games. Edge: What has been the toughest thing to get working properly? ML: Creating my vision...at 30Hz.\u2075 We were certain from day one that dropping below that refresh rate would destroy the immersive experience - and destroy the portal, as it were. It took six months to get the code strong enough so we could run the number of polygons we needed, with the texture bit-depths we wanted, and never drop below 30 frames per second. We began with enticing but near-empty environments - I enjoyed the peace and tranquility, but knew they must soon grow in scope and scale, populated with thinking, breathing characters\u2076 and unexpected transformations. Thus, my programmers have fought the speed problem throughout the entire project, but continue to win out. We keep hearing murmurs from within the industry that Opus Interactive have been using \u2018dark arts\u2019\u2077 on our hardware to achieve the look we have. This is simply untrue. We believe there is yet more to squeeze out of the Nintendo 64. Edge: How do you see the development of 3D platform games progressing? ML: I think simulating the third dimension is going to add a new dimension to all life experience [sic]. I think Mario 64was just the beginning. And I think there is a lot to be explored in that direction. And while I have great memories from the SNES days, I also believe that the classic style of 2D gaming is dead. Now, half of our jobs as designers is to learn how to mourn and move on...or choose not to.\u2078 Of course, we grew up on Mario, and Mr. Miyamoto\u2019s innovations and design expertise are nearly unmatched in the industry. I want to reiterate that nothing I have said in this interview should be taken as criticism of anything in Mario 64. Miyamoto-san continues to produce quality [sic]. And it\u2019s clear he really loves the medium. At E3 I watched him play Catastrophe Crow. He was completely absorbed from the moment he touched the controller. I think that is a powerful sign. Edge: How much longer do you see the development of Catastrophe Crowtaking? Staff have politely talked about your \u2018perfectionism\u2019 - at what point do you have to say \u2018enough\u2019? ML: I confess I get very absorbed in my projects. Such that time feels of little consequence to me. My producer has given me a Christmas 1999 release and I am at peace with that...for now. It is a good time for a release. It would be great for my daughter to see the fruits of my labour, and her own design, on Christmas Day. But I contest that the idea of \u2018perfectionism\u2019 is a false one. There is either \u2018finished\u2019 or \u2018not\u2019. \u2018Art\u2019 or \u2018trash\u2019. To put it bluntly, the portal either works or it doesn\u2019t. Edge: What are your plans after this? ML: I cannot imagine anything afterCatastrophe Crow. \u00b9 Japanese honorifics. Strangely, Miyamoto is referred to as \u201cMr. Miyamoto\u201d later in the interview, before switching back to \u201cMiyamoto-san.\u201d \u00b2 A good indication that even before Manfred\u2019s breakdown, the game was already somewhat of a reflection of his life. \u00b3 This was quoted in the N64 Future Look scan, indicating that this interview was made before that. \u2074 Looks like Edge paraphrased Manfred a bit.I don\u2019t think Edge really understood what Manfred was saying in this interview, considering how little follow-up questions they ask. You have a notoriously eccentric developer saying strange things and you don\u2019t think to ask for clarifications? \u2075 \u201c30 Hz,\u201d or 30 frames per second an unusual choice of wording since PAL is normally 50 Hz or 50 frames per second. However, actual frame rates on the N64 can vary wildly, sometimes struggling to hit 30 fps. The Nintendo 64\u2019s CPU (93.75 Mhz) and graphics (62.5 Mhz) are greater. Awake Human brain waves are about 30 Hz, however, so perhaps he\u2019s not referring to frame rate? \u2076 \u201cThinking,\u201d perhaps an indication of attempts to program complex AI? \u2077Taking \u201cdark arts\u201d literally has been wonderful fodder for our theorists. \u2078 Odd choice of words.Perhaps Thea had already died when this interview was made?However, that would contradict the later statement \u201cIt would be great for my daughter [to see the release] on Christmas Day.\u201d Locations \u00b6 None of these levels have been given official names so far, so nicknames are given here for convenience. Grounds \u00b6 First seen at 2:00 in What Happened to CROW 64? and is prominent throughout the videos. The Grounds is a grassy valley with a path between a house (called \u201cHome\u201d in this document) and an office building labeled \u201cWork\u201d. Bushes, flowers, and butterflies are placed throughout, a prominent natural archway stands above the path between Home and Work, but the two parts of the arch do not meet. In Forest Level, the skybox changes to a pyramidal shape. Work Building \u00b6 An office building with large text saying \u201cWORK\u201d in front of it. In the back there is a vent leading to a secret puzzle area. On top is the key to the Vigene\u0300re Cipher. Inside are portals in the form of computers to the Toy and Forest Levels. It has five stories. In the interview, there\u2019s a screenshot of the Grounds at night, with street lights leading up to the Work Building. Home (No sufficient info) \u00b6 A house, apparently where Father and Mr. Crow live. Likely represents the Lorenz house.It appears and disappears multiple times throughout the videos, and hasn\u2019t been explored in a \u201cnormal\u201d state. Pyramid \u00b6 First seen briefly at 1:29 in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? and later much darker in Forest Level. Pyramids are notably tombs in real life. It has not been explored on video thoroughly yet. The hieroglyphs, \u201c\ud80c\uddf3\ud80c\udd43\ud80c\udef9\u201d (sun/N5-falcon/G5-ankh/S34) above the gate translate to \u201cmay Re live.\u201d The other symbols may have some meaning as well.When it appears at the end of Forest Level and in the Workstation Dump, it has green highlights instead of pink. NewTotem_Boat appears to be blank at first glance, but is actually an image of a boat or basket, possibly the hieroglyph \ud80c\udf9f (basket/V30.) NewTotem_Cat looks a lot like a pentagram missing a line, but it has not been identified as of yet. NewTotem_Crow has what appears to be a halo.It does not match any hieroglyphs. NewTotem_Eye is the Eye of Horus (D10.) NewTotem_Water is similar to but different from the hieroglyphs \ud80c\ude16 and \ud80c\ude17 (ripple of water/N35 and three ripples of water/N35A), but appears closer to the Aquarius symbol (\u2652\ufe0e.) Kid World \u00b6 First seen at 2:00 in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? This level is grassy and decorated with gigantic toys, specifically letter blocks, a chess set, and a teddy bear. Jaunty music plays, but it gives way to blowing wind as Mr. Crow ventures away from the \u201cnormal\u201d play area. A large platform of letter blocks is above it, but it cannot be seen from the ground. Contains chess pieces as enemies. These pieces remain on the chessboard, guarding some silver coins. The letter blocks change between visits, possibly a subtle product of the Eternal Revival System. Forest Level/Graveyard \u00b6 Path taken in Let\u2019s Play Catastrophe Crow! Ep. 1 and in WHAT HAPPEND TO CROW 64? Bandage Crow refers to Mr. Crow and Small Crow refers to Brother Crow First seen at 2:09 in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64?, and then multiple times after. Accessible on the second floor of the Work Building. Multiple notable events in the videos occur here, such as the stair-falling incident, suggesting that this forest has some importance to the Lorenzes and may represent a real location.The Forest Level is a forest with thick fog, and contains, among other things, a bridge area, a well, a grave, Crawler, and the same stairs that appear at Home. In the screenshot included in the Planet 64 scan, Mr. Crow is standing in front of a large out-of-place door, which has not been seen yet on video. In addition, there are multiple indications (Planet 64 scan and 2:09 of WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64?) that Monks were present in the level at some point, but they have not been seen on video. Flying Fish Bridge \u00b6 A bridge with Flying Fish jumping over. It appears at 2:09 in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64 and again in Let\u2019s Play Catastrophe Crow! 64 - Ep1. In its first appearance, the bridge is straight, but in the let\u2019s play it is constructed of letters. It\u2019s possible that these are two different bridges, since the coast is closer and more parallel in the first appearance. Mirror Hill & Well (No Sufficient info) \u00b6 The mirror where the Crawler appears is elevated upon a hill and is near a well. Tunnel Level (No Sufficient info) \u00b6 Accessed in Video after Mr. Crow falls through multiple other levels. Underground Level \u00b6 Accessed in Catastrophe Crow! - Underground Level where it contains a large computer whose monitor opens up to reveal a large crow head upon solving a puzzle. Lava level \u00b6 First seen at 2:00 in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? and later briefly in Video. Contains moving gears. Was legitimately accessible in earlier versions, considering its appearance in the Planet64 scan, but has not been accessed during \u201cnormal\u201d gameplay on video yet. Ice Leve \u00b6 First seen at 2:00 in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? and later briefly in Video. Inhabited by Monks. Was legitimately accessible in earlier versions, considering its appearance in the Planet64 scan, but has not been accessed during \u201cnormal\u201d gameplay on video yet. Test Level (No Sufficient info) \u00b6 Seen only briefly in Video. Appears to be the Super Mario 64 DS Test Level with modified textures and an additional ramp. Moon Level (No Sufficient info) \u00b6 Thus far only seen in \u201cCatastrophe Crow!\u201d Development Documents 2 and its corresponding tweet. The model used to represent it in Development Documents 2 is called \u201cMoon\u201d in the Workstation Dump. Germany And Italy \u00b6 Cuxhaven \u00b6 Where the Lorenzes lived during the public development of Catastrophe Crow. Cuxhaven is a small coast town in the north of Germany. It is a popular tourist destination and historically was a major fishing wharf for Hamburg. Important note:while the house used as the Lorenz house has been located, the actual real house is almost certainly not intended to play a role in the ARG. Please do not bother the people who live in it. Hambug \u00b6 Where the office of Opus Interactive was. Hamburg is a large historically, culturally, and financially significant city in northern Germany. Hamburg is one of three cities in Germany that are part of their own Bundesland (state). Schwarzwald/Black Forest \u00b6 A large forest in southern Germany, near the border with France. A candidate for the holiday location due to being the most notable of the German forests, but its size likely means that if the holiday location is here, it needs to be narrowed down further.This area is considered for the Lorenz holiday location due to being forested and having tourist attractions. Bispingen & Wilseder Berg \u00b6 The eBay auction listing for the development cartridge was as being in Bispingen. It is a small municipality known for being a popular vacation destination. It is about 52 kilometers (32 miles) south of Hamburg. It contains a nature reserve, the Wilseder Berg, which is populated by heather and more loosely by trees. Vallombrosa \u00b6 Vallombrosa is a summer resort in Tuscany, Italy. It lies within a forest, and contains a nature reserve. It is a tourist destination. Laurentum \u00b6 Important ancient but now unpopulated town in Lazio, Italy between Ostia and Antium (Anzio.) It was regarded as the original capital of the Latins. The Villa of Pliny the Younger is located in its former location. It\u2019s the origin of the \u201cLorenz\u201d family name. Unlikely to be the holiday location on account of no longer existing. Helgoland & Wattensee Islands \u00b6 Islands in the North Sea. Notably many are connected to ornithological (bird) study and conservation and two are tourist destinations. The Lorenz holiday destination is possibly Helgoland or Neuwerk, considering their proximity, tourist attraction, and connection to birds, and considering that the latter three islands are neither readily open to the public nor have facilities for a holiday, but are mentioned here for completeness. Helgoland (German) or Heligoland (English) is a pair of islands of historical and cultural significance. They lie 69 kilometers (43 miles) from Cuxhaven. It is both a vacation destination and an important location of ornithological study. Neuwerk is a small island 13 kilometers (8 miles) from Cuxhaven, and can be reached on foot during low tide, making it a popular tourist spot. It has a population of 32. Nigeh\u00f6rn/Nigehoern is a tiny island 15 kilometers (9 miles) from Cuxhaven. It has been a bird sanctuary since 1989, but public visits are prohibited starting at an unknown time. Scharh\u00f6rn/Scharhoern is an even smaller island 15 kilometers (9 miles) from Cuxhaven. Public access is forbidden with the exception of tours. It serves as a bird sanctuary. Sylt (too far north to be on the map above) is an island off the western coast of Schleswig and is a jet ski tourist destination. It\u2019s about 119 kilometers (74 miles) from Cuxhaven. Trischen is a small island about 22 kilometers (14 miles) from Cuxhaven. It is only populated from March to October by a bird warden as it is part of a national park. Many birds visit throughout the year United States \u00b6 The commonly used picture of Manfredis speculated to have been taken on the American Great Lakes or on a man made lake in the American Midwest or Florida, going by the trees in the photo and by the American-branded beer (Pabst) sitting near Manfred.

And I to You.\u201d Why is \u201cYou\u201d capitalized? What was taken? \u201cI have - finally - gone home.\u201d What does he mean by home? Where is Marta? \u00b6 Marta left Germany 6 months before Manfred\u2019s disappearance. It\u2019s unclear if she is missing, but her motives for leaving Germany and current circumstances are unknown to us. What Does the Ringing Phone Mean? \u00b6 A ringing but unanswerable phone appears multiple times, including notably before Mr. Crow falls down the stairs. What does it mean? Appearances: WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? at 8:30 in the Work building. WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? at 11:00 before Mr. Crow falls down the stairs. At Forest Level at 2:00 when Mr. Crow returns to the office. What are the Creatures? \u00b6 The creatures, in particular Scarecrow and Crawler, seem to have some importance. Are they AI generated? Human created? Supernatural? What are their intentions? Scarecrow and Crawler are commonly speculated to represent Marta and Nils respectively because of their appearance in Catastrophe Crow N64, but why do those people also get crows representing them? And why would they be represented as monsters? What is Sir Cat? \u00b6 Sir Cat, despite being stated as being the main villain of the Catastrophe Crow game\u2019s plot has not appeared in person yet. His only presence so far is with the \u201ccatanic circles.\u201d Is Sir Cat a metaphorical/literal demon? Is he keeping Manfred from passing on? Why the Satanic reference? Why was there a catanic circle around Father Crow coding in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? What Exactly Is the \u201cEternal Revival\u201d System? \u00b6 For such a unique and important mechanic, we know so little about it. Supposedly it changes the game after each death, but we haven\u2019t seen much of its capabilities. It has effectively no presence in the workstation dump aside from the start up sound. In addition, howdoes this system work, especially on the Nintendo 64? And is \u201cEternal Revival\u201d even the correct translation? Theories and Speculation \u00b6 For the sake of readability, this section will not be marked. Keep in mind all of the following are theories and speculation created by the community. Theories are listed loosely in order of likeliness, from most to least. This list isn\u2019t comprehensive due to the nature of ARGs encouraging theory-crafting, and thus this section focuses on those that haven\u2019t been covered elsewhere in the document. Mr. Crow Fell Down the Stairs \u00b6 Current consensus is that the person Mr. Crow represents was injured by falling down the stairs. However, it\u2019s uncertain when this occurred (before Thea\u2019s drawing or during development), and if this fall was fatal. Mr. Crow falling down the stairsin WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? Is the main evidence for this. Magnum Opus \u00b6 \u201cOpus Interactive\u201d may be a reference to the alchemical concept of the \u201cMagnum Opus,\u201d or \u201cGreat Work,\u201d a substance that can convert common metals to gold, rejuvenate, and grant immortality. Taking this concept and applying it to Catastrophe Crow, there are two trains of thought: Literal:After the death of Thea Lorenz, Manfred Lorenz dedicated the development of the game to making her \u201cimmortal\u201d by coding an AI in her image, taking advantage of the \u201cEternal Revival\u201d system\u2019s dynamic capabilities. This process might include more traditional occultism too. Figurative:After the death of Thea Lorenz, Manfred Lorenz dedicated the development of the game to making something that would honor her memory, and projected her image and life story onto Mr. Crow. Following the train of thought of the literal interpretation of this theory, the red circle of pawns in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? is a decagram, a twice repeated pentagram used in Hermetic alchemy, each point representing an emanation of the Sefirot. The Sefirot, or \u201cTree of Life,\u201d is a Talmudic Jewish and Hermetic alchemist belief that God has 10 emanations through which He can be communed with. However, this symbol is fairly uncommon in comparison to other symbols. BMB\u2019s Speculative Timeline of Builds \u00b6 The videos may contain different builds of the game, or at least the game altered through the eternal revival system. BMB from the Discord attempted to make a timeline of these builds. Speculative Thea and Manfred Backstory \u00b6 Unfortunately the links leading to this theory has expired. @AdermanUlrich is Run by Manfred \u00b6 While Ulrich Aderman is (in universe) a real person, the Twitter account by his name may actually be run by Manfred instead. Original theory by bird here Why does Ulrich have the workstation? If he stole it for preservation, why wait until now to act on that? If he stole it for personal use, wouldn\u2019t some if not all Catastrophe Crow files have been deleted to make space? If he stole it out of spite, why would he still have it and not have sold it? An at home workstation seems unlikely, since Manfred\u2019s perfectionism and controlling nature makes it unlikely that he would allow work outside the office. Circumstantial Evidence The last email before December 5th from M L was on October 21st, and on October 22nd Ulrich Aderman\u2019s Twitter was created. On November 7th, Ulrich responded to a question from Paradox Factor on Twitter, apologizing by saying he was traveling. In the days prior, _ (Oct 29) and _ (Nov 4) were uploaded, two videos interpreted as Manfred waiting for Nils. Why would Ulrich have the development documents? Not too out there, but still strange that he would keep 20 year old documents. Any explanation of why Ulrich has the workstation has issues. Manfred, on the other hand, is explicitly noted as having taken all the development hardware when he disappeared. The Phone Ringing Represents Manfred\u2019s Absence \u00b6 The ringing phone represents Manfred\u2019s absence from his family as he grew more obsessed with working on Catastrophe Crow. When Thea fell down the stairs, he ignored calls from Marta, which is why the phone can\u2019t be answered. Alternatively, it represents Manfred avoiding his home life, including Thea\u2019s injury. Catanism \u00b6 Sir Cat is mentioned in the scans as the villain of the game\u2019s \u201cbizarre plot,\u201d but the only reference to him found in the Unity dump is these \u201cCatanic Circles.\u201d Combined with the fact his name sounds remarkably similar to \u201ccircuit,\u201d perhaps Sir Cat is a malevolent entity, possibly AI. Notable is the fact one of the few catanic circles found thus far was connected pawns around Father Crow coding. Manfred Lorenz is Trapped in the Game \u00b6 Somehow, Manfred Lorenz has gotten himself trapped in the game. Doubt has been cast on this theory as Manfred was trying to meet up with Nils in the real world unless he got trapped in the game and then later freed. \u201cAnd Manfred Lorenz entered the 3D realm and never come [sic] back! [Laughs]\u201d, a quote from Manfred in the Interview scan. \u201cI am in Hell, one of my own making\u201d The Stairs are Symbolic \u00b6 Instead of a literal staircase accident, the stairs represent a sudden decline in Mr. Crow\u2019s condition. DNA Chart \u00b6 The texture that appears after Mr. Crow falls down the stairs and in Let\u2019s Play Catastrophe Crow! Ep. 1 after encountering Crawler resembles a DNA chart Lightning Struck Mr. Crow \u00b6 As can be seen in the original drawing and in one of the drawings in the children\u2019s room in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64?, Mr. Crow has been struck by lightning, suggesting that the person he represents was struck by lightning in real life. Supporting this is that the brain scan flash looks like a flash of lightning. Seizures \u00b6 Seizures can be compared to a lightning storm, and Mr. Crow falling down the stairs also resembles a seizure. Plus, the brain scan images appear when he tumbles. However, it should be noted that seizures in real life typically aren\u2019t this dramatic, and the seizure imagery is just coincidental. Tying into the lightning theory, it\u2019s possible Mr. Crow experienced a lightning seizure, a momentary and abrupt loss of consciousness combined with spasms. Lightning seizures also can cause long term brain damage or even death Supplemental Material \u00b6 Thematic thoughts on Catastrophe Crow by ParadoxFactor.

I don;t know how to feel about this situation and I don\u2019t know if I can trust you. I feel like I\u2019m dreaming. Is there anything you can do to clear this up for me? Is there anything you can tell me so I know it\u2019s you? Something from my childhood. Where did my sister go to school? Where did we vacation. What was our house like? 10/19 ML:You speak like him, as I imagine he would. With questions painful to answer. But the imposters multiply, I feel I cannot take another step. All I can do is wait. Perhaps it is just a little longer. 10/20 10:49 Nils L:I guess that\u2019s understandable, but know I am being honest. This whole situation is gnawing at the back of my mind, and I\u2019ve been struggling with how to handle everything. I\u2019d like answers. But if you feel unsure I understand, as I feel the same way. Take as much time as you need. I will be here. Waiting. 10/21 M L: I see us standing on either side of the chasm. Neither alive or dead.

Kaleb, a video game enthusiast K: Hello, my name is Kaleb, growing up my favorite genera of game was the 3D platformer and the genre still remains in a special part of my heart today. I\u2019m always looking for a classic platformer I haven;t played yet, so when a game I never heard of stared popping up in my recommendation box it instantly got my attention and I was intrigued to find out that these videos had hidden messages in them. You may have seen some of my comments on some of the videos picking apart their puzzles. I now realize that while these videos are public these messages weren\u2019t intended for everyone. But still, I am touched by your story from what I can make of it. So if there is anything I can do to help please let me know.

I've been recently playing one of your games (Catastrophe Crow) on my channel and it's been pretty fun! It reminds me of numerous other platformers, yet it's bigger and better than them. I've been looking into the company you managed and worked on the game (Opus Interactive) and I found another game you worked on, \"Ocean Quest\". Another channel like mine uploaded a song from the game. I'm curious if you have any more information on it, since I was quite fascinated by Catastrophe Crow. So if you don't mind, could you share some details with me? Thanks! ML: And \u201cLore\u201d Another creation running by itself N64LLL: Someone was recently selling a development of Catastrophe Crow on the site ebay.com 2 weeks ago. For details, it had a label with numerous dates on it on the bottom, and it had \"CROW\" written in sharpie on the top. I was about to buy it but someone bought it before me, right after I discovered the Ebay page, to be exact. But here's a screenshot I took before they bought it. A screenshot of the eBay auction from the documentary was included. Would you happen to know information about who bought it, or the seller? Really just any information you happen to know about the cartridge sold on Ebay? If so, please share the information with me! Thanks! ML:So he never received it... It is all so long ago now.

A surprise addition to the main presentation at Spaceworld was Catastrophe Crow, a game bearing more than a passing resemblance to Rare\u2019s own animal-related newie, Banjo-Kazooie.Its playing set-up will be comfortably familiar to most Mario-followers, with the eponymous \u2018Crow legging it around lushly-created 3D worlds and jumping on badguys\u2019 heads.\u00b9 The demo showed off all kinds of fluid moves from wall-jumps to hanging-off-ledges, but we suspect we\u2019ll never fly until we get that bandage off our wing\u2026 The slightly-hard-to-read Press Release promised \u2018fearless exploration of unfamiliar worlds\u2019\u00b2 and detailed a surreal plot about trying to save your father\u2019s business from a corporate takeover by the sinister Sir Cat. The company skyscraper appears to form a Peach\u2019s-Castle-style hub from which you access a range of unique-looking worlds, from a misty forest to a land of giant toys to some kind of mysterious Ancient Egyptian Spaceship thing-y. And while the format currently screams \u2018SM64-clone\u2019 the developers have promised something called an \u2018eternal revival system\u2019 to keep things changing every time you play. This will be the first N64-outing from Opus Interactive, a German developer helmed by director Manfred Lorenz, whose action-adventure Ocean Questwas a surprise late hit for the SNES. With an unconfirmed release date set not for another two years, we expect more information to come through rather slowly on this one. But considering Opus Interactive\u2019s lasting reputation for great gameplay and impressive world-building, we at N64can\u2019t wait to actually get our thumbs on it Mr Crow sure looks cute, even as he navigates a somewhat creepy block world.

We\u2019ve had our beady N64 eye on Catastrophe Crow!For quite a few issues now. In development at Opus Interactive\u2019s Hamburg base for something approaching three years, it\u2019s a game that\u2019s looked consistently amazing in every screenshot we\u2019ve seen. When given the opportunity to play it for ourselves, we jumped at the chance. Visuals\u00b7The game brims with imagination and wonder, and, thanks to the expansion pak, is rendered in bright ultra-crisp detail. Based on a very strange storyline indeed, Catastrophe Crow!Consists of nine massive 3D worlds in desperate need of exploration. You play as the eponymous Crow, who runs head-first into their\u00b9 father\u2019s office to collect Power Coins and stop a corporate takeover by the evil Sir Cat. Much like Peach\u2019s Castle in Super Mario 64, this tower block serves as a hub-world to get you to each exciting new level - jumping appropriately into computer screens to explore the levels within. And explore we did. Because Catastrophe Crow!Is absolutely brimming with imagination and wonder. We\u2019ve clambered up giant teddy bears, sneaked around misty forests and hot-footed our way through a giant lava-powered machine. It\u2019s truly giving Super Mario 64and Banjo-Kazooiea run for their money in terms of world design. Of course, where comparisons are also going to be made is to SM64\u2019s move-set, which emphasises free-wheeling acrobatics over BK\u2019s more complicated-and-sometimes-clunky moves. We\u2019ve enjoyed flipping from triple-jumps to wall-jumps to hanging off ledges. If Crow\u2019s wing wasn\u2019t so adorably bandaged maybe we might even fly...perhaps an unlockable secret if we collect enough Power Coins. But while jumping on platforms and battling bizarre baddies is exceptionally fun, the few hours we\u2019ve spent with the game have slowly revealed a surprisingly deep and puzzle-y extra layer. The more we;ve explored, the more we\u2019ve got a sense of the game hiding something larger...cryptic clues in character dialog, a strange code found in forgotten corners of the levels, even a bizarre sci-fi pyramid filled with hieroglyphics. Manfred Lorenz - Catastrophe Crow!\u2019s notoriously enigmatic director - has long-hinted he\u2019s been making something perhaps more akin to Mystthan a kid-friendly platformer, remarking that \u201cgames are made of code, but they also are codes.

But is this really Europe\u2019s answer to Super Mario 64? And can it compete? Edgespoke with Opus Interactive\u2019s founder Manfred Lorenzduring the show. Edge: When did work start on Catastrophe Crow? ML: I had been wanting to enter the world of true 3D for many years, but didn\u2019t know my starting point for some time. The, one day, my daughter spontaneously sketched a character - a hapless crow with a bandaged wing - and my vision suddenly became clear. The entire company was set to work on Catastrophe Crowby January 1996. Edge: What design objectives did you start with? ML: When one begins thinking about working in 3D, one makes the mistake of thinking there are \u2018six\u2019 degrees of freedom: above, below, left, right, in, and out. In computer terms, that is perhaps correct, but to the player the actual feeling of movement and freedom is nearly infinite. I needed to do justice to that feeling. So while we will grab the players with the action and playforming, the larger design must allow players to truly explore. In truth, I believe what we are creating beyond a game - perhaps a portal of sorts. In Catastrophe Crowone can explore our worlds but also explore within...finding meaning within the gameplay. The Crow is the cleverest animal, so the mind must be required throughout. Edge: Does this relate to the \u2018eternal revival system\u2019 you mentioned? Could you tell us more about that? ML: [Laughs] A little. The thought began with the idea of Game Overs - which are now fossils from the coin-ops and nothing more. Now that the player is presented with a real world they wish to explore and solve, having lives and dying felt too cruel. So we created something else. Something where, in the event you die, your soul remains constant, but the world around you inevitably changes. I confess this element is still a work in progress. Edge: How do you think the project compares to other big 3D platformers, NiGHTSand Super Mario 64? ML: I think that many months ago three teams set out to create their vision of a 3D platform game. Miyamoto-san went free-roaming, Naka-san\u00b9 went for the feeling-of-flight. And Manfred Lorenz tried to enter the 3D realm and neve [sic] come [sic] back! [Laughs] Were these three games on the same platform, I think there would be less competition between them. I think Mario 64is brilliant. However, I don\u2019t think it resembles the oldMariogames in execution. NiGHTSwas fun as well. But it definitely was not an attempt by Naka-san to create another Sonic. Like Mario, I think NiGHTSis an excellent game\u2026 but it wasn\u2019t a platformer in the strictest sense. And both, if I am honest, are missing some \u2018truth\u2019. When we eventually release Catastrophe Crow, I am unsure if it will be considered a platformer at all. Our goal has always been to push the boundaries of player experience. Catastrophe Crowis built on a freedom of movement but also a freedom of thought. Edge: On that point, are there going to be a lot of puzzles in this game? ML: I think \u2018puzzles\u2019 is the wrong word. Instead, I have always thought of games as the ultimate expression: one in which the player \u2018lives through\u2019 the experiences of the creator.\u00b2 Since the first cave painting, there has been an impossible-but-crossable gap between the audience and the artist. Like two points made of rock or stone - a precipice with no bridge between. To put it another way: games must be made of code, but they also are codes. There must always be a gap, and a leap of faith between player and designer.\u00b3 Miyamoto-san went free-roaming Naka-san went for the feeling-of-flight, We will enter the 3D realm And never come back...\u2074 Edge: The game sounds like it\u2019s exploring some fascinating ideas - is the story first written in English or German? What is your process there? ML: English, I like to keep a bilingual household. Indeed, I encourage my entire team to speak and code in English when working on Catastrophe Crow. Of course, we will localise in German and French and Italian etceteraonce we are close to release, but for now this is how we work. As long as English remains the primary root of computer code, it must also be the mother tongue of games. Edge: What has been the toughest thing to get working properly? ML: Creating my vision...at 30Hz.\u2075 We were certain from day one that dropping below that refresh rate would destroy the immersive experience - and destroy the portal, as it were. It took six months to get the code strong enough so we could run the number of polygons we needed, with the texture bit-depths we wanted, and never drop below 30 frames per second. We began with enticing but near-empty environments - I enjoyed the peace and tranquility, but knew they must soon grow in scope and scale, populated with thinking, breathing characters\u2076 and unexpected transformations. Thus, my programmers have fought the speed problem throughout the entire project, but continue to win out. We keep hearing murmurs from within the industry that Opus Interactive have been using \u2018dark arts\u2019\u2077 on our hardware to achieve the look we have. This is simply untrue. We believe there is yet more to squeeze out of the Nintendo 64. Edge: How do you see the development of 3D platform games progressing? ML: I think simulating the third dimension is going to add a new dimension to all life experience [sic]. I think Mario 64was just the beginning. And I think there is a lot to be explored in that direction. And while I have great memories from the SNES days, I also believe that the classic style of 2D gaming is dead. Now, half of our jobs as designers is to learn how to mourn and move on...or choose not to.\u2078 Of course, we grew up on Mario, and Mr. Miyamoto\u2019s innovations and design expertise are nearly unmatched in the industry. I want to reiterate that nothing I have said in this interview should be taken as criticism of anything in Mario 64. Miyamoto-san continues to produce quality [sic]. And it\u2019s clear he really loves the medium. At E3 I watched him play Catastrophe Crow. He was completely absorbed from the moment he touched the controller. I think that is a powerful sign. Edge: How much longer do you see the development of Catastrophe Crowtaking? Staff have politely talked about your \u2018perfectionism\u2019 - at what point do you have to say \u2018enough\u2019? ML: I confess I get very absorbed in my projects. Such that time feels of little consequence to me. My producer has given me a Christmas 1999 release and I am at peace with that...for now. It is a good time for a release. It would be great for my daughter to see the fruits of my labour, and her own design, on Christmas Day. But I contest that the idea of \u2018perfectionism\u2019 is a false one. There is either \u2018finished\u2019 or \u2018not\u2019. \u2018Art\u2019 or \u2018trash\u2019. To put it bluntly, the portal either works or it doesn\u2019t. Edge: What are your plans after this? ML: I cannot imagine anything afterCatastrophe Crow. \u00b9 Japanese honorifics. Strangely, Miyamoto is referred to as \u201cMr. Miyamoto\u201d later in the interview, before switching back to \u201cMiyamoto-san.\u201d \u00b2 A good indication that even before Manfred\u2019s breakdown, the game was already somewhat of a reflection of his life. \u00b3 This was quoted in the N64 Future Look scan, indicating that this interview was made before that. \u2074 Looks like Edge paraphrased Manfred a bit.I don\u2019t think Edge really understood what Manfred was saying in this interview, considering how little follow-up questions they ask. You have a notoriously eccentric developer saying strange things and you don\u2019t think to ask for clarifications? \u2075 \u201c30 Hz,\u201d or 30 frames per second an unusual choice of wording since PAL is normally 50 Hz or 50 frames per second. However, actual frame rates on the N64 can vary wildly, sometimes struggling to hit 30 fps. The Nintendo 64\u2019s CPU (93.75 Mhz) and graphics (62.5 Mhz) are greater. Awake Human brain waves are about 30 Hz, however, so perhaps he\u2019s not referring to frame rate? \u2076 \u201cThinking,\u201d perhaps an indication of attempts to program complex AI? \u2077Taking \u201cdark arts\u201d literally has been wonderful fodder for our theorists. \u2078 Odd choice of words.Perhaps Thea had already died when this interview was made?However, that would contradict the later statement \u201cIt would be great for my daughter [to see the release] on Christmas Day.\u201d","title":"An audience with\u2026 Manfred Lorenz (1:38 in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64?)"},{"location":"main/#locations","text":"None of these levels have been given official names so far, so nicknames are given here for convenience.","title":"Locations"},{"location":"main/#grounds","text":"First seen at 2:00 in What Happened to CROW 64? and is prominent throughout the videos.

Figurative:After the death of Thea Lorenz, Manfred Lorenz dedicated the development of the game to making something that would honor her memory, and projected her image and life story onto Mr. Crow. Following the train of thought of the literal interpretation of this theory, the red circle of pawns in WHAT HAPPENED TO CROW 64? is a decagram, a twice repeated pentagram used in Hermetic alchemy, each point representing an emanation of the Sefirot. The Sefirot, or \u201cTree of Life,\u201d is a Talmudic Jewish and Hermetic alchemist belief that God has 10 emanations through which He can be communed with. However, this symbol is fairly uncommon in comparison to other symbols.","title":"Magnum Opus"},{"location":"main/#bmbs-speculative-timeline-of-builds","text":"The videos may contain different builds of the game, or at least the game altered through the eternal revival system.

Original theory by bird here Why does Ulrich have the workstation? If he stole it for preservation, why wait until now to act on that? If he stole it for personal use, wouldn\u2019t some if not all Catastrophe Crow files have been deleted to make space? If he stole it out of spite, why would he still have it and not have sold it? An at home workstation seems unlikely, since Manfred\u2019s perfectionism and controlling nature makes it unlikely that he would allow work outside the office. Circumstantial Evidence The last email before December 5th from M L was on October 21st, and on October 22nd Ulrich Aderman\u2019s Twitter was created. On November 7th, Ulrich responded to a question from Paradox Factor on Twitter, apologizing by saying he was traveling. In the days prior, _ (Oct 29) and _ (Nov 4) were uploaded, two videos interpreted as Manfred waiting for Nils. Why would Ulrich have the development documents? Not too out there, but still strange that he would keep 20 year old documents. Any explanation of why Ulrich has the workstation has issues. Manfred, on the other hand, is explicitly noted as having taken all the development hardware when he disappeared.","title":"@AdermanUlrich is Run by Manfred"},{"location":"main/#the-phone-ringing-represents-manfreds-absence","text":"The ringing phone represents Manfred\u2019s absence from his family as he grew more obsessed with working on Catastrophe Crow.
